- Document content directly supports assertion
- No timeline or party inconsistencies
- Strong cross-reference validation

**Medium Confidence (2 verified documents):**
- Two independent sources support claim
- Document content partially supports assertion
- Minor inconsistencies that don't undermine claim
- Moderate cross-reference validation

**Low Confidence (0-1 documents):**
- Single source or no documentation
- Weak evidentiary support
- Significant gaps or inconsistencies
- Additional discovery required

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Run complete fact-checking analysis:** Execute `ts-node fact-checker.ts` to populate this report
2. **Address critical gaps:** Focus on claims with 0-1 supporting documents
3. **Additional discovery:** Request documents identified in gaps analysis
4. **Evidence authentication:** Verify hash integrity for all cited documents

### Discovery Priorities
1. [To be determined based on analysis results]

### Litigation Strategy
1. Lead with high-confidence claims in filings
2. Strengthen medium-confidence claims through additional discovery
3. Defer low-confidence claims until evidence is secured
4. Leverage cross-reference findings to demonstrate patterns
