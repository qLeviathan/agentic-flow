**SEC Rules 21F-1 through 21F-17** (17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-1 et seq.)

### What is the SEC Whistleblower Program?

The SEC whistleblower program provides:
1. **Financial Awards:** 10-30% of monetary sanctions recovered (over $1 million threshold)
2. **Anti-Retaliation Protection:** Prohibition on retaliation for protected disclosures
3. **Confidentiality:** Protection of whistleblower identity
4. **Direct SEC Reporting:** Bypass internal compliance for direct SEC reporting

### Covered Violations

The SEC whistleblower program covers violations of:
- Securities Act of 1933
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934
- Investment Company Act of 1940
- Investment Advisers Act of 1940
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**
- Any SEC rule or regulation
- Any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders

### Applicability to Castillo's Case

**Potential SEC Violations:**

1. **SOX Section 302 False Certifications**
   - CEOs/CFOs falsely certifying accuracy of financial statements
   - Misrepresenting effectiveness of internal controls
   - Failure to disclose internal control deficiencies

2. **SOX Section 404 Internal Controls Failures**
   - Inadequate internal controls over financial reporting
   - Failure to assess effectiveness of controls
   - False auditor attestations

3. **ERISA/Benefit Plan Mismanagement**
   - Material misrepresentations to shareholders about benefit plan management
   - Financial statement impacts from improper claim reserves
   - Undisclosed liabilities affecting shareholder value

4. **Fraud Against Shareholders**
   - Concealment of systemic fraud in subsidiary operations (Sedgwick)
   - Material omissions in financial disclosures
   - Failure to disclose regulatory violations

5. **Rule 21F-17(a) Violations**
   - Attempts to prevent whistleblower from contacting SEC
   - Enforcement of confidentiality agreements to impede SEC reporting

### Rule 21F-17(a) - Prohibition on Impeding Whistleblower Communications

**Text of Rule 21F-17(a):**
> "No person may take any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission staff about a possible securities law violation, including enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality agreement... with respect to such communications."

**Violations Include:**
- Language in severance agreements preventing SEC contact
- Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) restricting SEC reporting
- Confidentiality agreements blocking whistleblower disclosures
- Internal policies restricting SEC communications
- Compliance manuals prohibiting external reporting
- Training materials discouraging whistleblower activity

**SEC Enforcement:**
The SEC has stepped up enforcement of Rule 21F-17, bringing actions against companies that use overly broad confidentiality provisions to chill whistleblowing.

**Castillo's Case:** Any confidentiality provisions in Schwab employment agreements or severance that restrict SEC reporting may violate Rule 21F-17(a).
