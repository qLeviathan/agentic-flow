**Generated:** 2025-11-16T20:14:50.000Z
**Case:** Castillo v. Schwab & Sedgwick
**Analysis Type:** Evidence Sufficiency Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report identifies claims that lack sufficient supporting documentation and recommends specific discovery actions to address evidentiary gaps.

### Gap Statistics

- **Claims with <2 Supporting Documents:** [PENDING]
- **Critical Gaps (0 documents):** [PENDING]
- **High Priority Gaps (1 document):** [PENDING]
- **Missing Evidence Types:** [PENDING]

---

## CRITICAL GAPS (0 Supporting Documents)

Claims with NO supporting documentation require immediate attention:

### [To be populated after analysis]

**Impact:** These claims cannot proceed without supporting evidence and may need to be withdrawn or amended if documentation cannot be obtained.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediate discovery requests for all identified evidence types
- Subpoena relevant parties if documents are not produced voluntarily
- Consider alternative evidence sources (witness testimony, circumstantial evidence)

---

## HIGH PRIORITY GAPS (1 Supporting Document)

Claims with only ONE piece of supporting evidence need additional corroboration:

### [To be populated after analysis]

**Impact:** Single-source evidence is vulnerable to challenge. Additional documentation strengthens credibility and meets dual verification standard.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Request corroborating documentation from multiple sources
- Identify contemporaneous records that support claim
- Secure witness statements if documentary evidence is unavailable
