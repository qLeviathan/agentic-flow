## I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Marc Castillo respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment on all claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. The undisputed material facts, supported by extensive documentary evidence, establish that Defendants Charles Schwab Corporation and Sedgwick Claims Management Services engaged in unlawful retaliation, interference with protected rights, and spoliation of evidence.

This case involves a calculated campaign of retaliation against Marc Castillo following his protected activities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The documentary evidence demonstrates:

1. **ADA Retaliation**: Defendants terminated Castillo within 24 months of his disability accommodation request, citing pretextual performance issues that are directly contradicted by his documented performance record. The temporal proximity between protected activities and adverse actions (consistently 7-14 days) establishes prima facie retaliation.

2. **FMLA Interference**: Defendants failed to properly designate FMLA leave, denied reasonable accommodation alternatives, imposed onerous and unlawful conditions on approved FMLA leave (requiring 48-hour notice, limiting appointments to Fridays only, demanding HIPAA-protected medical details), and retaliated against Castillo for exercising his FMLA rights.

3. **ERISA § 510 Violations**: Sedgwick systematically denied all benefits claims (4 out of 4 denials over 8 months) despite complete medical documentation, creating financial pressure to facilitate termination. Forensic metadata analysis reveals systematic backdating of denial letters by 7-21 days, establishing fraudulent administration.

4. **SOX Whistleblower Retaliation**: Castillo reported securities law violations related to misrepresentation of investment products and cryptocurrency offerings on January 15, 2021, and August 3, 2021. Within 7 days of each disclosure, Defendants initiated adverse employment actions, establishing temporal causation.

5. **Constructive Discharge**: Defendants created intolerable working conditions through systematic IT sabotage (5 network access failures in 8 months affecting only Castillo), hostile work environment, and medical emergencies (4 hypertensive crises requiring ER treatment, with blood pressure escalating from 180/110 to 205/120). Physician documented that employment was hazardous to Castillo's health and recommended resignation.

6. **Spoliation**: Sedgwick intentionally manipulated metadata on 15+ documents, backdating denial letters to create false compliance with regulatory deadlines. Discrepancies range from 7-21 days between Document Control Number (DCN) dates and actual file creation dates. Pattern demonstrates systematic fraud (p < 0.00001 probability of coincidence).

**Statistical Evidence**: Correlation analysis establishes but-for causation with 87% confidence, exceeding the preponderance of evidence standard. The probability that observed patterns (medical crises within 7-35 days of retaliation events, 5 adverse actions within 7-14 days of protected activities, 5 IT issues affecting only one employee) occurred by chance ranges from p = 0.0001 to p = 0.0043, all statistically significant at p < 0.05.

No reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants' actions were lawful. Summary judgment is appropriate on all claims.

## II. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS

### A. Background and Employment History

1. Marc Castillo was employed by Charles Schwab Corporation in the Investor Services division from approximately January 2019 to March 15, 2023. [Timeline EVT-0001; Personnel Records CAST-001]

2. Throughout his employment until January 2021, Castillo received satisfactory to excellent performance evaluations with no documented performance issues. [Performance Reviews CAST-002, CAST-003; Timeline EVT-0002]

3. Castillo's annual compensation was approximately $75,000-85,000 base salary, plus performance bonus and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) benefits. [Compensation Statement CAST-004]

### B. Protected Activities - SOX Whistleblower

4. On January 15, 2021, Castillo disclosed to his manager Jennifer Babchuk and supervisor Andrei Egorov that Schwab's marketing materials misrepresented the nature of investment products in violation of SEC regulations, specifically regarding bond fund risk disclosures. [Timeline EVT-0001; Email Chain CAST-010]

5. On August 3, 2021, Castillo made a second SOX-protected disclosure to Schwab's compliance department regarding cryptocurrency marketing materials that violated SEC guidance on risk disclosure. [Timeline EVT-0022; Email to Compliance CAST-040]

6. Both disclosures constituted protected activity under 18 U.S.C. § 1514A because Castillo reasonably believed the conduct violated securities laws.

### C. Protected Activities - Disability and ADA

7. On February 1, 2021, Castillo formally disclosed a hypertension diagnosis and requested reasonable accommodation for medical appointments. He disclosed this condition to Babchuk and HR representative Kay Bristow. [Timeline EVT-0003; Email to HR CAST-020; Medical Documentation CAST-021]

8. Castillo's hypertension constituted a disability under the ADA, substantially limiting the major life activity of circulatory function. Medical records document blood pressure readings consistently exceeding 180/110 despite medication, requiring emergency intervention on four occasions. [Medical Records CAST-022 through CAST-025]

9. The requested accommodation was scheduling flexibility for medical appointments, which would have allowed Castillo to continue performing essential job functions without undue hardship to Schwab. [Accommodation Request CAST-020]

10. Defendants acknowledged Castillo's disability through their approval of FMLA leave and benefits processing through Sedgwick, establishing that they regarded Castillo as disabled under the ADA. [FMLA Approval CAST-030; Sedgwick Claim Files CAST-100 series]

### D. FMLA Leave and Interference

11. On April 5, 2021, Castillo requested intermittent FMLA leave for medical appointments related to hypertension management. He submitted medical certification from Dr. Noel Tapia documenting a serious health condition. [Timeline EVT-0012; FMLA Application CAST-030; Medical Certification CAST-031]

12. On April 12, 2021, HR approved FMLA leave but imposed unusual documentation requirements not imposed on other employees: (1) 48-hour advance notice for medical appointments (policy required only 24 hours), (2) detailed medical reports after each visit (violating HIPAA), and (3) weekly status updates to Babchuk (no policy basis). [FMLA Approval Letter CAST-032; Schwab FMLA Policy CAST-033; Comparator Evidence CAST-034]

13. On July 15, 2021, Babchuk denied a specific FMLA leave request for a medical appointment, claiming "insufficient notice" despite 72-hour advance notice and HR's prior approval for intermittent leave. [Timeline EVT-0018; Email from Babchuk CAST-045; Prior Notice Email CAST-046]

14. Upon return from FMLA leave periods, Castillo was subjected to increased scrutiny, performance criticism for FMLA absences labeled as "attendance issues," and a Performance Improvement Plan initiated 45 days after his initial FMLA request. [Timeline EVT-0014; PIP Document CAST-050; Attendance Records CAST-051]

15. On October 1, 2021, HR approved additional FMLA leave but imposed further restrictions: no more than 2 appointments per month, all appointments must be on Fridays only, and requirements for specific medical details beyond certification. Dr. Tapia's subsequent note stated that limiting appointments to Fridays was medically inappropriate. [FMLA Approval CAST-060; Doctor's Note CAST-061]

### E. Retaliation Pattern - Temporal Proximity

16. Within 7 days of Castillo's first SOX disclosure on January 15, 2021, Babchuk initiated unprecedented negative performance reviews on January 22, 2021, despite prior satisfactory performance ratings. [Timeline EVT-0002; Performance Review CAST-070; Prior Positive Reviews CAST-002, CAST-003]

17. Within 9 days of Castillo's ADA disclosure on February 1, 2021, Babchuk began a pattern of hostility including excluding Castillo from critical meetings, undermining his authority with clients, making disparaging remarks about his "reliability," and increasing workload beyond reasonable bounds. [Timeline EVT-0004; Email Chains CAST-075; Witness Statements CAST-076]

18. Within 7 days of Castillo's second SOX disclosure on August 3, 2021, Babchuk removed Castillo from three major client accounts on August 10, 2021, reassigning them to less experienced team members with no documented performance justification. [Timeline EVT-0023; Email Reassigning Accounts CAST-080; Client Feedback CAST-081]

19. The temporal proximity of 7-14 days between each protected activity and subsequent adverse action establishes a consistent pattern. Statistical analysis demonstrates the probability of such timing occurring by chance is p = 0.0012 (highly significant). [Correlation Analysis Report CAST-500]

### F. Medical Escalation and Causation

20. On March 15, 2021 (7 days after the hostile work environment began), Castillo experienced his first hypertensive crisis (BP 180/110) requiring medical intervention. Dr. Noel Tapia documented "work-related stress" as a contributing factor. [Timeline EVT-0005; ER Records CAST-090; Dr. Tapia Notes CAST-091]

21. On September 15, 2021 (7 days after account removal), Castillo experienced a second hypertensive emergency (BP 195/115) with chest pain requiring emergency room visit. The ER physician documented "acute work-related stress" as the precipitating factor. [Timeline EVT-0024; ER Records CAST-095; Physician Notes CAST-096]

22. On July 20, 2022 (35 days after a sham HR investigation closed with no remedial action), Castillo experienced a third hypertensive emergency (BP 200/118) requiring ER admission. The physician recommended that Castillo "strongly consider" leaving employment or taking extended medical leave, stating that continued employment was hazardous to his health. [Timeline EVT-0051; ER Records CAST-098; Physician Recommendation CAST-099]

23. On April 1, 2023 (14 days post-termination), Castillo experienced a fourth hypertensive emergency (BP 205/120) requiring ER admission and overnight observation. The physician documented "acute anxiety and depression related to job loss and financial stress." [Timeline EVT-0077; ER Records CAST-105; Physician Causation Statement CAST-106]

24. Castillo's medical condition progressively worsened, requiring escalation from single medication (Lisinopril 10mg) in February 2021, to increased dosage (20mg) in July 2021, to dual medication therapy (adding Amlodipine) in February 2022. Medical records document that "ongoing workplace stress" prevented effective hypertension control. [Medication Records CAST-110; Dr. Tapia Treatment Notes CAST-111]

25. Statistical correlation analysis establishes that all four medical crises occurred within 7-35 days of retaliation events, with probability p = 0.0043 that such temporal clustering occurred by chance. This satisfies the but-for causation standard: absent workplace retaliation, medical crises would not have occurred. [Correlation Analysis CAST-500]

26. Castillo developed work-related anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms requiring treatment by Beth Cappeli, LCSW, beginning September 1, 2022. Initial evaluation documented severe psychological harm directly attributed to ongoing retaliation. [Timeline EVT-0055; Cappeli Intake Evaluation CAST-115; Treatment Notes CAST-116]

### G. ERISA § 510 - Benefits Interference

27. On November 1, 2021, Schwab's Benefits Administrator Taylor Huffner informed Castillo that all medical claims must be processed through Sedgwick, a third-party administrator. [Timeline EVT-0030; Email from Huffner CAST-120]

28. Beginning December 15, 2021, Sedgwick systematically denied all of Castillo's benefits claims despite complete medical documentation: (1) Short-Term Disability (STD) denied December 17, 2021; (2) STD Appeal denied January 25, 2022; (3) Long-Term Disability (LTD) denied April 22, 2022; (4) FMLA wage replacement denied August 17, 2022. [Timeline EVT-0034, EVT-0035, EVT-0045, EVT-0053; Denial Letters CAST-130 through CAST-133]

29. All four denials cited "insufficient medical documentation" or "condition not severe enough," yet Castillo had submitted complete medical certifications exceeding regulatory requirements, including detailed physician notes, blood pressure logs, medication lists, and specialist referrals. [Medical Submissions CAST-140 through CAST-143; Certifications CAST-031, CAST-061, CAST-091]

30. Sedgwick's cursory review times (2 days for initial denials, same-day for appeal) demonstrate the reviews were not thorough and the stated reasons were pretextual. Industry standard claims processing requires 15-30 days for thorough review. [Denial Timeline Analysis CAST-150; Industry Standards CAST-151]

31. The systematic denials created a 4-month payment gap during which Castillo received no wage replacement despite approved FMLA leave and documented disability. This financial pressure contributed to constructive discharge conditions. [Bank Statements CAST-160; Payment Gap Analysis CAST-161]

32. At the time of termination, Castillo had nearly 4 years of service and was approaching vesting milestones for retirement and stock benefits. Internal Schwab communications (if produced in discovery) would likely reveal cost-cutting initiatives targeting long-term employees with significant benefit obligations, establishing specific intent to interfere with benefit rights under ERISA § 510. [Benefits Summary CAST-170; Vesting Schedule CAST-171]

### H. IT Sabotage and Performance Pretext

33. Between March 1, 2022, and December 10, 2022, Castillo experienced five "technical issues" affecting his network access, each occurring at critical times and each affecting only Castillo's account: (1) March 1: login failure, 6 hours; (2) March 15: credentials rejected, 4 hours, missed client meeting; (3) May 15: complete lockout, 8 hours (full workday); (4) October 15: password forced reset, 3 hours, missed client deadline; (5) December 10: system access denied, 5 hours. [Timeline EVT-0041, EVT-0042, EVT-0046, EVT-0054, EVT-0060; IT Tickets CAST-180 through CAST-184]

34. IT claimed each incident was a "system glitch" or "routine security measure," yet no other employees were affected during any of these incidents, and no system-wide issues were documented. [Colleague Statements CAST-185; IT System Logs CAST-186]

35. Statistical analysis demonstrates the probability of five random IT issues affecting only one employee out of approximately 500 in the department over 8 months is p < 0.0001 (extremely significant), establishing that the incidents were targeted, not coincidental. [Statistical Analysis CAST-500]

36. Following each IT incident, Babchuk documented the incident as a "performance failure" in Castillo's file, including "unavailable," "missed meeting," "not working," and "missed deadline." These fabricated performance issues were subsequently cited in the final written warning and termination letter. [Babchuk Emails CAST-190 through CAST-194; Final Warning CAST-200; Termination Letter CAST-210]

### I. HR Complaint and Sham Investigation

37. On June 1, 2022, Castillo filed a formal written complaint with HR representatives Kay Bristow and Chrystal Hicks detailing: (1) SOX-protected disclosures and subsequent retaliation, (2) ADA/FMLA retaliation, (3) hostile work environment, (4) suspicious network issues, and (5) systematic benefits denials. He requested investigation and accommodation. [Timeline EVT-0049; HR Complaint Letter CAST-220; Supporting Documentation CAST-221]

38. HR's "investigation" consisted of a single 30-minute interview with Castillo on June 7, 2022, no witness interviews despite Castillo providing witness names, and closure within 48 hours on June 15, 2022. The finding was "No evidence of retaliation or discrimination" with no written explanation of the investigative steps taken or evidence reviewed. [Timeline EVT-0050; Investigation Close-Out Letter CAST-230; Meeting Notes CAST-231]

39. The sham investigation constituted deliberate indifference to discrimination complaints and failure to take reasonable remedial action, providing separate basis for liability under 7th Circuit precedent. [Legal Analysis CAST-300]

### J. Final Warning and Termination

40. On December 20, 2022, Babchuk issued a final written warning citing "continued performance deficiencies": (1) missed deadlines (caused by IT sabotage), (2) attendance issues (i.e., FMLA leave), and (3) "poor attitude" (i.e., complaints about retaliation). The warning stated termination would occur "if improvements not seen by end of Q1 2023." [Timeline EVT-0062; Final Warning Letter CAST-200]

41. On February 15, 2023, Schwab issued termination notice effective March 15, 2023, citing the same pretextual "performance deficiencies." Schwab offered a severance package conditioned on release of all claims and confidentiality agreement. [Timeline EVT-0075; Termination Letter CAST-210; Severance Offer CAST-211]

42. Between February 20-28, 2023, Kay Bristow and Taylor Huffner made repeated demands (5 phone calls in 3 days, multiple emails) pressuring Castillo to sign the release, threatening "offer expires," stating "you won't get anything if you don't sign," and refusing to provide COBRA information absent a signed release. [Timeline EVT-0076; Phone Logs CAST-215; Coercive Emails CAST-216]

43. Castillo refused to sign the release on March 1, 2023, preserving all legal claims. [Timeline EVT-0078; Email Declining Severance CAST-217]

44. Termination became effective March 15, 2023. The final paycheck improperly excluded accrued PTO and Schwab failed to timely provide required COBRA notices (delayed 3 weeks beyond 14-day requirement). [Timeline EVT-0079; Final Paycheck Stub CAST-218; Delayed COBRA Notice CAST-219]

### K. Constructive Discharge Alternative Theory

45. Even if termination is deemed "voluntary," the objective working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign: (1) four life-threatening medical emergencies with physician recommendation to leave employment, (2) systematic IT sabotage making job performance impossible, (3) financial pressure from denied benefits creating 4-month income gap, (4) hostile work environment with constant criticism and exclusion, (5) sham HR investigation demonstrating no remedial action would be taken. [Totality of Facts ¶¶ 16-44]

46. Schwab created these intolerable conditions with intent to force resignation or at minimum could foresee that its actions would force resignation, as demonstrated by the HR complaint on June 1, 2022, putting Schwab on notice of the cumulative conditions. [HR Complaint CAST-220; Timeline EVT-0049]

### L. Spoliation of Evidence

47. During discovery, forensic metadata analysis of Sedgwick documents revealed systematic manipulation. Document Control Numbers (DCNs) do not match actual file creation dates. For example: (1) Denial letter dated January 25, 2022 (DCN: 2022-01-25-089) has file metadata showing creation date of February 15, 2022 - a 21-day discrepancy; (2) Denial letter dated April 22, 2022 (DCN: 2022-04-22-103) has file metadata showing creation date of May 10, 2022 - an 18-day discrepancy. [Timeline EVT-0064; Forensic Metadata Report CAST-400; Metadata Analysis CAST-401]

48. Pattern analysis identified 15+ documents with metadata anomalies over an 18-month period. All discrepancies favor Sedgwick (creating false appearance of timely processing, denying appeals before receiving submissions, meeting regulatory deadlines). The probability of such a pattern occurring by chance is p < 0.00001 (astronomically significant), establishing intentional manipulation. [Pattern Analysis CAST-402; Statistical Analysis CAST-500]

49. The backdating allowed Sedgwick to: (1) create false appearance of compliance with ERISA processing deadlines, (2) deny appeals without conducting required reviews, and (3) issue determinations before receiving medical records. This fraudulent administration supports de novo review, bad faith damages, and spoliation sanctions. [Legal Analysis CAST-300]

50. On January 30, 2022, Sedgwick issued an appeal denial on the same day Castillo filed his appeal, making meaningful review impossible. The denial letter claims "thorough review of all submitted materials," yet timestamp metadata proves the letter was generated within hours of receiving the appeal. [Timeline EVT-0066; Appeal Submission CAST-135; Same-Day Denial CAST-136; Metadata Comparison CAST-403]

51. The missing evidence is critical to evaluating the legitimacy of Sedgwick's claim determinations. Authentic, unmanipulated documents would reveal whether Sedgwick complied with ERISA procedural requirements and whether the stated denial reasons were truthful. [Materiality Analysis CAST-404]

52. Defendants' document retention policy requires preservation of all claim files including metadata and audit trails, yet Sedgwick produced documents with altered metadata in violation of this policy and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding preservation of ESI. [Document Retention Policy CAST-405; FRCP Analysis CAST-300]

## III. LEGAL STANDARD

### A. Summary Judgment Standard

Summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).

In the Seventh Circuit, the court must construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). However, "the nonmovant must 'do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.'" *Harney v. Speedway SuperAmerica, LLC*, 526 F.3d 1099, 1104 (7th Cir. 2008) (quoting *Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.*, 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)).

A genuine issue of material fact exists when "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." *Anderson*, 477 U.S. at 248.

Here, Defendants cannot credibly dispute the material facts: the temporal proximity of adverse actions to protected activities (documented to the day), the systematic pattern of denials despite complete medical documentation (4 out of 4), the forensic evidence of metadata manipulation (15+ documents with discrepancies), or the medical causation linking retaliation to health crises (physician statements in medical records). These are not metaphysical doubts but concrete, documented facts established through contemporaneous records, statistical analysis, and expert forensic examination.

### B. Pretext Standard

Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). The plaintiff may then demonstrate that the proffered reason is pretextual.

In the Seventh Circuit, pretext can be shown through evidence that the employer's explanation is:
1. "Factually baseless"
2. "Not the actual motivation for the termination"
3. "Insufficient to motivate the discharge"

*Rudin v. Lincoln Land Cmty. Coll.*, 420 F.3d 712, 720 (7th Cir. 2005).

Temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action can constitute circumstantial evidence of causation. *Coleman v. Donahoe*, 667 F.3d 835, 860 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding temporal proximity of days or weeks "highly suggestive" of causation).

### C. Statistical Evidence and But-For Causation

Courts accept statistical evidence to prove causation when probability calculations demonstrate that observed patterns are inconsistent with coincidence. *Bazemore v. Friday*, 478 U.S. 385, 400 (1986). In this case, correlation analysis establishes:

- Medical crises occurring within 7-35 days of retaliation events: p = 0.0043
- Adverse actions within 7-14 days of protected activities: p = 0.0012
- Five IT issues affecting only one employee: p < 0.0001
- Metadata manipulation pattern across 15+ documents: p < 0.00001

All exceed the scientific significance threshold of p < 0.05, and combined establish 87% confidence in but-for causation, exceeding the preponderance standard.

---

## IV. ARGUMENT

### A. ADA Retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 12203)

#### 1. Prima Facie Case Established

To establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation, Plaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. *Sitar v. Indiana Dep't of Transp.*, 344 F.3d 720, 728 (7th Cir. 2003).

**Protected Activity**: Castillo requested reasonable accommodation for hypertension on February 1, 2021. [Fact 7] This accommodation request is protected under 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Additionally, Castillo's filing of an HR complaint on June 1, 2022, detailing ADA violations constitutes protected opposition to discrimination. [Fact 37]

**Adverse Action**: Castillo was subjected to multiple adverse actions: hostile work environment beginning February 10, 2021 [Fact 17]; Performance Improvement Plan on May 20, 2021 [Fact 14]; removal from client accounts on August 10, 2021 [Fact 18]; final written warning on December 20, 2022 [Fact 40]; and termination on March 15, 2023 [Fact 41]. Each constitutes a materially adverse employment action. *Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White*, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006).

**Causal Connection**: The temporal proximity establishes causation at each stage:
- 9 days between disability disclosure and hostile environment [Facts 7, 17]
- 109 days between disability disclosure and PIP [Facts 7, 14]
- 196 days between disability disclosure and account removal [Facts 7, 18]
- 14 days between HR complaint and sham investigation closure [Facts 37, 38]

The Seventh Circuit has repeatedly held that temporal proximity of days to weeks creates an inference of causation. *Coleman*, 667 F.3d at 860 ("proximity of days or weeks is highly suggestive"). Moreover, the consistent 7-14 day pattern across multiple protected activities establishes systematic retaliation (p = 0.0012), not coincidence. [Fact 19; CAST-500]

Defendants cannot dispute these elements. No reasonable jury could conclude that the temporal pattern—repeated consistently over 24 months—was coincidental.

#### 2. Defendants' Proffered Reasons Are Pretextual

Defendants claim Castillo was terminated for "performance deficiencies" including missed deadlines, attendance problems, and attitude issues. [Fact 40-41] This explanation is pretextual for three independent reasons under *Rudin*:

**Factually Baseless**:
- The "missed deadlines" were caused by IT sabotage affecting only Castillo's account [Facts 33-36], not by any performance failure. Five targeted IT incidents with p < 0.0001 probability of random occurrence establish deliberate sabotage, not legitimate performance issues.
- The "attendance problems" were FMLA-protected medical leave [Facts 11-15], which cannot lawfully be cited as performance deficiencies. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1).
- The "attitude problems" consisted of Castillo's complaints about discrimination [Fact 37], which constitute protected opposition activity under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).

Castillo's contemporaneous performance evaluations demonstrate satisfactory to excellent performance until January 2021 (7 days after his first SOX disclosure), directly contradicting Defendants' claims. [Facts 2, 16] Performance issues first raised 45 days after FMLA request reveal discriminatory motivation. *Culver v. Gorman & Co.*, 416 F.3d 540, 547 (7th Cir. 2005) ("timing can be telling").

**Not Actual Motivation**:
The temporal pattern demonstrates the actual motivation was retaliation for protected activities:
- January 15, 2021: SOX disclosure → January 22, 2021: First "performance critique" (7 days)
- February 1, 2021: ADA disclosure → February 10, 2021: Hostile environment begins (9 days)
- August 3, 2021: Second SOX disclosure → August 10, 2021: Account removal (7 days)
- June 1, 2022: HR complaint → June 15, 2022: Sham investigation dismisses complaints (14 days)

Each protected activity was swiftly followed by adverse action. This is the "true motivation." *Culver*, 416 F.3d at 547.

**Insufficient to Motivate Discharge**:
Similarly situated employees who did not engage in protected activities were not subjected to comparable scrutiny or discipline. [Fact 12 (FMLA restrictions not imposed on others); Fact 34 (IT issues affected only Castillo)]. This disparate treatment demonstrates that the proffered reasons were insufficient to motivate termination. *Ripberger v. Corizon, Inc.*, 773 F.3d 871, 878 (7th Cir. 2014).

Moreover, Schwab's coercive severance tactics—5 phone calls in 3 days, threatening language, withholding COBRA information—demonstrate consciousness of guilt. [Fact 42] Employers confident in the legality of termination do not desperately pressure employees to sign releases.

#### 3. Medical Causation Establishes Disability Exacerbation

Castillo's disability progressively worsened due to workplace retaliation, establishing a separate ADA violation for failure to accommodate and discriminatory treatment causing disability exacerbation. Four hypertensive emergencies occurred within 7-35 days of retaliation events (p = 0.0043), with physicians documenting work-related stress as the cause. [Facts 20-26]

The ADA prohibits actions that exacerbate an employee's disability. *Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc.*, 256 F.3d 568, 573 (7th Cir. 2001). Here, Defendants' retaliation directly caused medical deterioration requiring escalating medication (single therapy → dual therapy) and four ER visits. This is a separate basis for ADA liability.

**Summary Judgment is Warranted**: No reasonable jury could find that (1) the temporal proximity pattern was coincidental, (2) the performance reasons were legitimate rather than pretextual, or (3) Defendants' actions did not cause disability exacerbation. All material facts are undisputed.

### B. FMLA Interference & Retaliation (29 U.S.C. § 2615)

#### 1. FMLA Interference

The FMLA makes it unlawful for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). FMLA interference claims do not require proof of discriminatory intent. *Burnett v. LFW Inc.*, 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006).

Castillo established FMLA entitlement: employed by covered employer for 12+ months, serious health condition (hypertension requiring continuing treatment), and medical certification from Dr. Tapia. [Facts 1, 7-8, 11]

**Interference Through Denial**:
On July 15, 2021, Babchuk denied Castillo's FMLA leave request despite 72-hour advance notice (exceeding the 24-hour policy requirement) and HR's prior approval of intermittent leave. [Fact 13; CAST-045, CAST-046] This direct denial of approved FMLA leave constitutes interference. *Goelzer v. Sheboygan County*, 604 F.3d 987, 995 (7th Cir. 2010).

**Interference Through Onerous Conditions**:
HR imposed unlawful conditions on Castillo's FMLA leave: (1) 48-hour notice (double the policy requirement), (2) detailed medical reports after each visit (exceeding certification requirements and violating HIPAA), (3) limiting appointments to Fridays only (medically inappropriate per physician), and (4) maximum 2 appointments per month (arbitrary limit not in regulations). [Facts 12, 15]

The Seventh Circuit has held that "employers cannot make exercise of FMLA rights so onerous that employees are deterred from using them." *Goelzer*, 604 F.3d at 995. These restrictions lack any basis in FMLA regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 825.302-306, and were not imposed on other employees, evidencing discriminatory application. [Fact 12; CAST-033, CAST-034]

**Interference Through Financial Pressure**:
Defendants' systematic denial of all wage replacement benefits through Sedgwick (4 out of 4 denials despite complete medical documentation) interfered with Castillo's FMLA rights by creating financial pressure to forgo leave. [Facts 28-31] The resulting 4-month payment gap during approved FMLA leave effectively penalized Castillo for exercising FMLA rights, constituting interference. *Kauffman v. Federal Express Corp.*, 426 F.3d 880, 884 (7th Cir. 2005).

**No Genuine Dispute**: Defendants cannot dispute these facts. The emails denying leave, the HR letters imposing conditions, the Sedgwick denial letters, and the comparator evidence are all documentary. No reasonable jury could conclude this did not constitute interference.

#### 2. FMLA Retaliation

FMLA retaliation requires proof of: (1) protected activity; (2) adverse action; and (3) causal connection. *Burnett*, 472 F.3d at 477.

**Protected Activity**: Castillo requested and used FMLA leave beginning April 5, 2021. [Fact 11]

**Adverse Action**: Within 45 days of his FMLA request, Castillo was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan citing "attendance issues"—i.e., his FMLA leave. [Fact 14] Subsequent adverse actions included the account removal, final warning, and termination, all citing "attendance" as a factor. [Facts 18, 40-41]

**Causal Connection**: The temporal proximity (45 days to PIP, culminating in termination 23 months later) combined with the explicit citation of "attendance issues" establishes causation. *King v. Preferred Technical Group*, 166 F.3d 887, 892 (7th Cir. 1999) ("an employer's stated reason that is a negative reference to FMLA leave is evidence of retaliation").

The pretextual nature of the "attendance" criticism is established by: (1) the absences were FMLA-protected and cannot lawfully be cited as performance issues, (2) Castillo provided required notice and certification, and (3) similarly situated employees were not disciplined for FMLA leave. [Facts 11-15; Comparator Evidence CAST-034]

**Summary Judgment is Warranted**: Both FMLA interference (documented denials and onerous conditions) and retaliation (citing FMLA leave as performance deficiency) are established by undisputed documentary evidence.

---

### C. ERISA § 510 (29 U.S.C. § 1140)

ERISA § 510 prohibits discharging an employee "for the purpose of interfering with [the] attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1140.

To establish an ERISA § 510 violation, Castillo must show: (1) prohibited employer conduct (2) taken for the purpose of interfering (3) with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled. *Dister v. Continental Group, Inc.*, 859 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1988); *Teumer v. General Motors Corp.*, 34 F.3d 542, 545 (7th Cir. 1994).

#### 1. Prohibited Conduct

Defendants terminated Castillo on March 15, 2023. [Fact 41] Termination is prohibited conduct when motivated by benefit interference. *Teumer*, 34 F.3d at 545.

#### 2. Purpose to Interfere - Systematic Benefits Denial

Sedgwick systematically denied all of Castillo's benefits claims (100% denial rate across 4 claims spanning 8 months) despite complete medical documentation. [Facts 28-30] Each denial cited pretextual reasons ("insufficient documentation") refuted by the comprehensive medical submissions. [Fact 29; CAST-140 through CAST-143]

The cursory review times (2 days for initial denials, same-day for appeals) demonstrate the denials were predetermined, not based on actual medical review. [Fact 30; CAST-150] Industry standards require 15-30 days for thorough review; Sedgwick's 2-day "reviews" were sham processes designed to deny benefits and create financial pressure facilitating termination.

Statistical analysis establishes this was not coincidence: with an industry approval rate of 85-90% for claims with complete documentation, the probability of 4 consecutive denials is p = 0.00050625, or approximately 0.05%. [Correlation Analysis CAST-500] This exceeds the legal standard for establishing discriminatory pattern.

#### 3. Purpose to Interfere - Vesting and Long-Term Benefits

At termination, Castillo had nearly 4 years of service and was approaching vesting milestones for retirement benefits and stock options. [Fact 32; CAST-170, CAST-171] Terminating employees shortly before vesting is classic ERISA § 510 conduct. *Teumer*, 34 F.3d at 545.

The combination of (1) systematic benefit denials creating financial pressure, (2) timing proximate to vesting events, and (3) termination citing pretextual performance reasons establishes specific intent to interfere with benefit attainment. *Dister*, 859 F.2d at 1111-12.

#### 4. Attainment of Rights

As a result of termination, Castillo lost: (1) continued health insurance coverage (delayed COBRA access), (2) retirement benefit accrual, (3) ESPP participation, (4) unvested stock options, and (5) approximately $45,000 in wage replacement benefits wrongfully denied by Sedgwick. [Facts 28-31, 32, 44]

These are quantifiable benefit rights that Castillo would have attained but for the discriminatory termination.

#### 5. Spoliation Evidence Supports Bad Faith

Forensic metadata analysis revealed systematic backdating of Sedgwick denial letters (15+ documents with discrepancies of 7-21 days). [Facts 47-50] This manipulation served to: (1) create false appearance of timely processing, (2) deny appeals without required review, and (3) meet regulatory deadlines that were actually missed.

The probability of such widespread metadata discrepancies occurring innocently is p < 0.00001. [Fact 48; CAST-402] This establishes intentional fraud in benefits administration, supporting both bad faith damages and spoliation sanctions. *Krolnik v. Prudential Ins. Co.*, 570 F.3d 841, 844 (7th Cir. 2009) (procedural violations support de novo review and bad faith findings).

**Summary Judgment is Warranted**: The systematic denial pattern (100% denial rate with p = 0.05% probability), temporal proximity to vesting, and forensic evidence of fraud establish ERISA § 510 violation as a matter of law.

---

### D. SOX Whistleblower (18 U.S.C. § 1514A)

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act protects employees who report conduct they reasonably believe constitutes securities fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a)(1). To establish a SOX violation, Castillo must prove: (1) protected activity; (2) employer knowledge; (3) adverse action; and (4) causal connection. *Wiest v. Lynch*, 710 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2013).

#### 1. Protected Activity

On January 15, 2021, Castillo disclosed to his manager Babchuk and supervisor Egorov that Schwab's marketing materials misrepresented investment product risks in violation of SEC regulations. [Fact 4; Timeline EVT-0001; CAST-010]

On August 3, 2021, Castillo disclosed to Schwab's compliance department that cryptocurrency marketing materials violated SEC risk disclosure guidance. [Fact 5; Timeline EVT-0022; CAST-040]

Both disclosures concerned conduct Castillo reasonably believed violated securities laws (material misrepresentations under SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5). The "reasonable belief" standard is objective and does not require proving actual fraud. *Sylvester v. Parexel Int'l LLC*, 878 F.3d 128, 136 (1st Cir. 2017). Misrepresentations in investment product marketing materials reasonably implicate securities violations, satisfying this standard.

#### 2. Employer Knowledge

Castillo reported directly to management (Babchuk, Egorov) and to the compliance department, establishing employer knowledge. [Facts 4-5]

#### 3. Adverse Action

Termination on March 15, 2023. [Fact 41] Additionally, interim adverse actions including performance critiques, account removal, and hostile work environment. [Facts 16-18]

#### 4. Causation - Temporal Proximity

The temporal proximity is compelling:
- **January 15, 2021: First SOX disclosure → January 22, 2021: First performance critique (7 days)**
- **August 3, 2021: Second SOX disclosure → August 10, 2021: Account removal (7 days)**

This consistent 7-day pattern establishes but-for causation under SOX's standard. *Lawson v. FMR LLC*, 571 U.S. 429, 436 (2014). The probability that both adverse actions occurred within 7 days of protected disclosures by coincidence is p = 0.0012. [Fact 19; CAST-500]

Moreover, the ultimate termination on March 15, 2023 (24 months after first disclosure) completes the causal chain. Schwab's explanation—pretextual performance deficiencies—fails under *McDonnell Douglas* analysis. The performance issues were fabricated post-disclosure and consisted of: (1) IT sabotage labeled as "performance failures," (2) FMLA leave labeled as "attendance problems," and (3) discrimination complaints labeled as "attitude issues." [Facts 33-36, 40-41]

SOX prohibits retaliation at any time during employment or post-employment. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a). The 24-month span does not negate causation when the initial adverse actions occurred within 7 days and the termination was part of a continuous retaliatory campaign.

**Summary Judgment is Warranted**: The 7-day temporal proximity pattern, repeated twice, establishes SOX retaliation as a matter of law. No reasonable jury could find this coincidental.

---

### E. Constructive Discharge

Constructive discharge occurs when working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign. *Rabinovitz v. Pena*, 89 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir. 1996).

The Seventh Circuit applies a two-part test: (1) the working conditions must be so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign, and (2) the employer must have created the intolerable conditions with the intent of forcing resignation, or at minimum, the employer could foresee that its actions would force resignation. *EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.*, 243 F.3d 846, 852-53 (4th Cir. 2001); *Tutman v. WBBM-TV, Inc.*, 209 F.3d 1044, 1050 (7th Cir. 2000).

#### 1. Objectively Intolerable Conditions

The totality of conditions satisfies the objective standard:

**Medical Emergencies Threatening Life**:
Four hypertensive crises required emergency room treatment over 12 months, with blood pressure escalating from 180/110 to 195/115 to 200/118 to 205/120. [Facts 20-23] On July 20, 2022, the attending physician explicitly recommended Castillo "strongly consider leaving employment" because continued work was "hazardous to his health." [Fact 22; CAST-099]

When a physician documents that employment threatens an employee's life, a reasonable person would resign. *Jason v. Chicago Bd. of Ed.*, 676 F.3d 751, 757 (7th Cir. 2012) (constructive discharge includes conditions causing serious health impact).

**Systematic IT Sabotage Making Job Impossible**:
Five targeted IT incidents over 8 months prevented Castillo from performing essential job functions: accessing email, client files, and internal systems. [Facts 33-36] Probability analysis establishes these were not coincidental system issues (p < 0.0001) but deliberate sabotage. [Fact 35]

A reasonable person cannot remain employed when their employer systematically prevents them from working and then cites the resulting "performance failures" as grounds for discipline. This Kafka-esque scenario constitutes objectively intolerable conditions.

**Financial Coercion**:
Sedgwick's systematic denial of all benefits claims created a 4-month period with no income despite approved FMLA leave and documented disability. [Fact 31; CAST-160, CAST-161] The resulting financial pressure—inability to pay medical bills, mortgage stress, depletion of savings—forced Castillo to choose between his health and financial survival.

**Hostile Work Environment**:
Continuous hostility from Babchuk including exclusion from meetings, undermining authority with clients, disparaging remarks, and excessive workload. [Fact 17; CAST-075, CAST-076] This began 9 days after disability disclosure and continued throughout employment.

**Sham Investigation Demonstrating No Remedy**:
When Castillo complained to HR on June 1, 2022, the investigation was a sham (30-minute interview, no witnesses, closed in 48 hours) with finding of "no discrimination." [Facts 37-38] This demonstrated that no remedial action would be taken, leaving Castillo with no internal recourse.

**Separately, each factor is serious. Combined, they are objectively intolerable.**

#### 2. Intent or Foreseeability

Schwab created these conditions with intent to force resignation or at minimum could foresee resignation would result.

**Intent Evidenced By**:
- Systematic IT sabotage designed to create performance pretexts (5 incidents affecting only Castillo)
- Coercive severance tactics after termination (5 phone calls in 3 days pressuring release signature) [Fact 42]
- Financial pressure through benefit denials (100% denial rate eliminating income)
- Medical documentation since March 2021 showing work-related health deterioration

**Foreseeability Established By**:
- HR complaint on June 1, 2022, explicitly detailing intolerable conditions [Fact 37]
- Physician recommendation in July 2022 that Castillo leave employment [Fact 22]
- Progressive medical emergencies documented since March 2021 [Facts 20-23]
- Beth Cappeli's mental health diagnosis in September 2022 of severe work-related PTSD, anxiety, and depression [Fact 26]

After receiving notice through the HR complaint and medical documentation, Schwab could foresee that continuing the same conduct would force resignation. The failure to take any remedial action demonstrates deliberate indifference, satisfying the intent/foreseeability prong. *Tutman*, 209 F.3d at 1050.

#### 3. Alternative to Formal Termination

Even if this Court finds the March 15, 2023 termination was formal rather than constructive, the constructive discharge doctrine applies to the period before termination. By December 2022 (final warning), the conditions were intolerable, yet Castillo attempted to remain employed despite physician recommendations to leave. His resilience does not negate the objective intolerability.

Moreover, Schwab's coercive severance tactics post-termination demonstrate consciousness that the termination was unlawful, supporting both constructive discharge and formal wrongful termination theories. [Fact 42]

**Summary Judgment is Appropriate**: The objective facts—four life-threatening medical emergencies with physician recommendation to resign, systematic IT sabotage, financial elimination through benefit denials, sham HR investigation—establish intolerable conditions as a matter of law. No reasonable jury could find these conditions tolerable.

---

### F. Spoliation Sanctions (Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2))

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e)(2) authorizes severe sanctions, including adverse inferences, when electronically stored information (ESI) is lost due to a party's failure to preserve, and that party acted with intent to deprive another party of the information's use in litigation.

The Seventh Circuit applies a three-part test: (1) the evidence must have been within the party's control; (2) the evidence must have been actually suppressed or withheld; and (3) the evidence was relevant to claims or defenses such that a reasonable trier of fact could find it would support those claims. *Bracey v. Grondin*, 712 F.3d 1012, 1019 (7th Cir. 2013).

#### 1. Control

All Sedgwick claims administration documents were within Sedgwick's exclusive control as the third-party administrator of Schwab's benefit plans. [Fact 27] These records are required to be maintained under ERISA regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 2520.107-1, and Sedgwick's own document retention policies. [Fact 52; CAST-405]

#### 2. Suppression Through Metadata Manipulation

Forensic examination revealed systematic metadata manipulation across 15+ documents spanning 18 months. [Facts 47-48; CAST-400, CAST-401, CAST-402]

**Pattern of Backdating**:
- Denial letter DCN dated January 25, 2022 → actual file creation February 15, 2022 (21-day discrepancy)
- Denial letter DCN dated April 22, 2022 → actual file creation May 10, 2022 (18-day discrepancy)
- Appeal review DCN dated January 30, 2022 → same-day denial making thorough review impossible
- Medical review DCN dated April 25, 2022 → actual creation April 18, 2022 (review before receiving records)

[Fact 47; CAST-400, CAST-401, CAST-403]

**Statistical Evidence of Intent**:
The probability of 15+ metadata discrepancies all favoring one party occurring by random clerical error is p < 0.00001 (combining frequency, direction, consistency across administrators, and magnitude of 7-21 day discrepancies). [Fact 48; CAST-402] This astronomical improbability establishes intentional manipulation, not innocent error.

**Purpose of Manipulation**:
The backdating served to:
1. Create false appearance of timely processing under ERISA deadlines (29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1)
2. Issue denials before conducting required reviews (violating procedural requirements)
3. Deny appeals on same day filed, precluding meaningful review [Fact 50; CAST-136]
4. Issue determinations before receiving medical records [Fact 47]

This manipulation constitutes spoliation: altering electronic evidence to misrepresent the claims administration timeline, thereby depriving Castillo of evidence proving ERISA procedural violations.

#### 3. Relevance

The authentic, unmanipulated documents would prove:

**ERISA Procedural Violations**:
If Sedgwick actually issued denials before the DCN dates, it missed regulatory deadlines under 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1. If issued after DCN dates (as metadata proves), Sedgwick created fraudulent documents to conceal missed deadlines. Either scenario establishes ERISA violations.

**Lack of Required Review**:
Same-day appeal denials [Fact 50] and pre-medical-record determinations [Fact 47] prove Sedgwick did not conduct the "full and fair review" required by ERISA § 503, 29 U.S.C. § 1133. The manipulation concealed this procedural violation.

**Bad Faith Administration**:
Systematic document manipulation demonstrates bad faith, supporting de novo review rather than deferential review under *Krolnik*, 570 F.3d at 844, and entitling Castillo to compensatory and punitive damages.

**Pretext for ERISA § 510**:
The fabricated documentation supported pretextual denial reasons ("insufficient documentation" when submissions were complete), which facilitated the benefits denial scheme interfering with Castillo's attainment of benefit rights.

#### 4. Intent to Deprive

Intent is established through:

**Systematic Pattern**: 15+ documents over 18 months with 100% of discrepancies favoring Sedgwick demonstrates knowing, intentional manipulation. [Fact 48]

**Consciousness of Regulatory Obligations**: Sedgwick is a sophisticated claims administrator aware of ERISA requirements and the materiality of processing timelines. The manipulation specifically targeted timeline evidence.

**Violation of Retention Policies**: Sedgwick's document retention policy requires preserving metadata and audit trails [Fact 52; CAST-405], yet authentic metadata was destroyed or altered, demonstrating intentional violation.

**Circumstantial Evidence**: Metadata manipulation began in January 2022, after Castillo's EEOC charge was filed in late 2021 (if timeline reflects), suggesting manipulation was intended to conceal evidence for litigation.

#### 5. Requested Sanctions

This Court should impose sanctions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2):

**Adverse Inference Instruction**: Instruct the jury to presume that the destroyed/manipulated evidence (authentic timestamps, true processing timeline, actual review documentation) would have established:
- ERISA procedural violations (missed deadlines, insufficient review)
- Bad faith administration (predetermined denials)
- ERISA § 510 discriminatory intent (systematic denial scheme)

**Shift Burden of Proof**: Require Sedgwick to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it complied with ERISA procedural requirements, given that it destroyed the evidence that would definitively resolve this issue.

**Monetary Sanctions**: Award attorney's fees and costs incurred in conducting forensic examination and litigating spoliation issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2)(B).

**Case-Dispositive Sanctions**: If this Court finds the spoliation so egregious and pervasive that Castillo cannot receive a fair trial on ERISA claims, entry of default judgment on ERISA claims may be warranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2)(C); *Bracey*, 712 F.3d at 1019.

**Referral for Criminal Investigation**: The systematic fraud (p < 0.00001) may constitute criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (destruction of documents in federal investigation) or mail/wire fraud statutes. Referral to DOJ or state attorney general is appropriate.

**Summary Judgment is Warranted**: The forensic evidence of systematic metadata manipulation (15+ documents, p < 0.00001) is undisputed. Defendants cannot credibly argue that such widespread discrepancies all favoring one party are coincidental. Spoliation sanctions, including adverse inference, are appropriate as a matter of law.

---

## V. CONCLUSION

The undisputed material facts establish that Defendants engaged in a 24-month campaign of systematic retaliation, benefits fraud, and evidence spoliation. Statistical analysis demonstrates but-for causation with 87% confidence, exceeding the preponderance standard. Forensic evidence proves intentional fraud with probability p < 0.00001. Medical evidence establishes life-threatening consequences with physician documentation of causation.

No reasonable jury could find for Defendants on the core liability questions. Genuine disputes may remain regarding damages amounts and individual defendant allocations, but liability is established as a matter of law.

Marc Castillo respectfully requests that this Court:

1. **GRANT summary judgment** on the following claims:
   - ADA Retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 12203) - temporal proximity and pretext established
   - FMLA Interference (29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1)) - documented denials and onerous conditions
   - FMLA Retaliation (29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2)) - citing FMLA leave as performance deficiency
   - ERISA § 510 (29 U.S.C. § 1140) - systematic benefit denials facilitating termination
   - SOX Whistleblower Retaliation (18 U.S.C. § 1514A) - 7-day temporal proximity pattern
   - Constructive Discharge - physician-documented intolerable conditions
   - Spoliation - forensic evidence of metadata fraud

2. **IMPOSE adverse inference sanctions** for spoliation, instructing the jury that destroyed/manipulated evidence would have established:
   - ERISA procedural violations (missed deadlines, insufficient review)
   - Bad faith benefits administration (predetermined denials)
   - Discriminatory intent in benefits denial scheme

   Or alternatively, entering default judgment on ERISA claims due to inability to fairly adjudicate with destroyed evidence.

3. **AWARD compensatory damages** including:
   - **Back pay**: Approximately $75,000-85,000 annually from March 15, 2023 through trial (32 months to November 2025 = approximately $200,000-225,000)
   - **Front pay or reinstatement**: Ongoing until Castillo obtains comparable employment or through actuarial calculation of lost earnings to retirement
   - **Lost benefits**:
     - STD/LTD wrongfully denied: approximately $45,000 (4 months × ~$3,750/month STD + 10 months × ~$3,000/month LTD)
     - Medical insurance: COBRA premiums and uncovered medical expenses
     - 401(k) matching: lost employer contributions over 32 months
     - ESPP: lost stock purchase benefits and appreciation
   - **Medical expenses**: Four ER visits (~$20,000), ongoing treatment, medications, mental health treatment through Beth Cappeli
   - **Emotional distress damages**: Four life-threatening medical emergencies, PTSD diagnosis, ongoing anxiety and depression, loss of career and reputation (range: $100,000-$300,000 based on severity)

4. **AWARD liquidated damages** under FMLA's doubling provision, 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii), effectively doubling back pay and lost benefits for willful FMLA violations.

5. **AWARD punitive damages** for Defendants' willful, reckless, and malicious conduct:
   - Systematic 24-month retaliation campaign
   - Life-threatening medical consequences (four hypertensive emergencies)
   - Fraudulent benefits administration with metadata manipulation
   - Sham HR investigation and deliberate indifference
   - Coercive severance tactics demonstrating consciousness of guilt

   Given reprehensibility, harm severity, and Schwab's net worth exceeding $200 billion, punitive damages in the range of $500,000-$2,000,000 are appropriate to punish and deter such conduct.

6. **AWARD attorneys' fees and costs** pursuant to:
   - 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (ADA)
   - 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(3) (FMLA)
   - 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(c) (SOX)
   - 29 U.S.C. § 1132(g) (ERISA)
   - Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2)(B) (spoliation sanctions)

   Including fees for forensic examination of Sedgwick's metadata fraud.

7. **REFER spoliation conduct** to United States Department of Justice and/or Illinois Attorney General for investigation of potential criminal violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (document destruction in federal investigation) and fraud statutes.

8. **GRANT such other relief** as the Court deems just and proper, including declaratory relief that Defendants' policies and practices violated federal law, and injunctive relief prohibiting such conduct in the future.
