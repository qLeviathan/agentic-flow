## Formative Assessment Guidelines

### Daily Exercise Rubric (Quick Check)
**Pass/Needs Improvement Scale:**

- **Pass:** Completed exercise, demonstrates understanding, engaged with agent support
- **Needs Improvement:** Incomplete, shows misunderstanding, or minimal effort

### Participation Rubric (Weekly)

## Self-Assessment Template

Students complete this for each major project:

### Self-Evaluation Questions:
1. **What are you most proud of in this project?**
2. **What was the biggest challenge you faced?**
3. **If you had more time, what would you improve?**
4. **What did you learn that surprised you?**
5. **Rate your effort (1-10) and explain:**

### Self-Grading:
Students grade themselves on rubric criteria before submission, then compare with instructor grade to build self-assessment skills.

---

## Peer Review Template

For collaborative and major projects:

### Peer Feedback Form:
1. **What works really well in this project?** (2 specific things)
2. **What's one suggestion for improvement?** (constructive)
3. **What technique did you learn from reviewing this work?**
4. **Rate: Technical (1-5), Creative (1-5), Overall (1-5)**

---

## Agent-Assisted Assessment

Agents can provide:
- **Real-time feedback** during exercises
- **Technique verification** (e.g., "Are they using ghost notes correctly?")
- **Progress tracking** across lessons
- **Personalized recommendations** for improvement

Instructor always makes final grade determination, but agent insights inform feedback.

---

## Late Work & Revision Policy

### Recommended Policy:
- **Late work:** -10% per day up to 3 days, then not accepted
- **Revisions:** Students may revise any assignment once within 1 week of feedback for up to 85% max
- **Extensions:** Available with prior arrangement for legitimate reasons
- **Portfolio:** Can include revised versions of earlier work

---

## Grading Best Practices

1. **Clear criteria before assignment:** Students see rubric before starting
2. **Formative feedback:** Ongoing comments during creation process
3. **Example work:** Show exemplars at different levels
4. **Audio comments:** Record audio feedback for music projects
5. **Growth focus:** Weight later projects more heavily to reward improvement
6. **Multiple attempts:** Allow practice and revision on techniques
7. **Celebration:** Showcase excellent work to class (with permission)
