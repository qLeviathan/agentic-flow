---

### Strategic Considerations
- [ ] **Damages quantification prepared** (for prevailing on motion)

- [ ] **Settlement leverage assessed:**
  - Strengths: Forensic spoliation evidence, statistical causation, medical documentation

**Status:** [ ] CALENDAR UPDATED [ ] PENDING

---

### Preparing for Opposition
- [ ] **Anticipate Defendants' arguments:**
  - Statute of limitations defenses (refuted by continuing violation doctrine)
  - Failure to establish prima facie case (refuted by temporal proximity and pretext evidence)
  - Legitimate non-discriminatory reasons (refuted by pretext analysis)

### Hearing Preparation
- [ ] **Oral argument outline prepared:**

- [ ] **Mock questions anticipated:**
  - Court: "Why should I grant summary judgment on damages, not just liability?"
  - Response: "Damages are calculable from undisputed payroll and medical records; alternatively, partial summary judgment on liability only is appropriate."

  - Court: "The 24-month gap between SOX disclosure and termination - isn't that too remote?"
  - Response: "The initial adverse actions occurred within 7 days; termination is culmination of continuous retaliation pattern; temporal proximity satisfied at each stage."

  - Court: "Pro se plaintiffs rarely get summary judgment. Why should you?"
  - Response: "The forensic evidence (p < 0.00001) and statistical analysis (p = 0.0012) eliminate any genuine factual dispute. This is not a credibility case; it's a documentary evidence case."

- [ ] **Professional attire selected** (suit, tie, professional appearance)

## NOTES & REMINDERS

### Strengths of Motion
1. **Forensic Evidence:** Metadata manipulation p < 0.00001 = smoking gun
2. **Statistical Analysis:** 87% but-for causation confidence exceeds preponderance standard
3. **Temporal Proximity:** Consistent 7-14 day pattern across multiple protected activities
4. **Medical Documentation:** Four ER visits with physician statements of work-related causation
5. **Documentary Evidence:** Emails, medical records, denial letters = no credibility contests

### Potential Weaknesses
1. **Pro Se Status:** Court may be skeptical of pro se plaintiff obtaining summary judgment
2. **Damages Quantification:** Less precise than expert actuary (but sufficient for partial summary judgment on liability)
3. **Expert Testimony:** Need experts for forensic and medical causation (currently pending)
4. **Comparator Evidence:** Some comparator evidence is from discovery, may be challenged

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Secure expert declarations immediately** (highest priority)
2. **Prepare for oral argument** (anticipate skepticism of pro se summary judgment)
3. **Consider partial summary judgment** (liability only, trial on damages) as fallback position
4. **Document settlement discussions** (may enhance credibility and demonstrate good faith)
