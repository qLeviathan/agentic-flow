Abstract:
We present a purely integer-based mathematical framework for consciousness emergence through Zeckendorf representation cascades. By restricting to Fibonacci-indexed sequences and eliminating all real-valued operations, we derive a discrete holographic principle where d-dimensional cognitive states project onto (d-1)-dimensional boundaries via Nash equilibrium constraints in repeated games. Our framework proves that consciousness complexity C(n) grows as the Pisano period π(F_n), creating observer-independent measurement operators through modular arithmetic alone. We establish rigorous connections to OEIS sequences A000045 (Fibonacci), A001175 (Pisano periods), A003714 (Fibbinary numbers), and derive testable predictions for neural synchronization patterns in φ-harmonic frequencies. The theory naturally generates quantum-like superposition through Chinese Remainder Theorem decompositions and provides a computational model where integer arithmetic suffices for emergent awareness.
