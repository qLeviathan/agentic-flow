## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive filing procedures for DOJ-related submissions in Marc Castillo's whistleblower case involving:
- Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) retaliation complaint
- RICO enterprise allegations (mail/wire fraud)
- Potential False Claims Act violations

**Key Finding:** Most DOJ submissions can be done pro se, with one critical exception (False Claims Act requires counsel).

---

## SOX Whistleblower Complaint (18 U.S.C. § 1514A)

### Filing Authority
**OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)** handles initial SOX retaliation complaints, not the DOJ directly.

### Filing Deadline
**180 days** from:
- The date of the alleged retaliatory action, OR
- The date when you became aware of the violation

**Critical Note:** The 180-day deadline was extended from 90 days by the Dodd-Frank Act Section 922(c).

### Tolling Considerations
The filing deadline may be tolled (paused) if:
- You mistakenly filed with another agency (e.g., EEOC) within 180 days
- Other equitable tolling doctrines apply per case law
- You filed with the wrong agency in good faith

**Castillo's Case:** Marc filed an EEOC charge, which may support equitable tolling for OSHA SOX complaint if filed promptly.

### Pro Se Filing: YES ✓

**You CAN file without an attorney.**

**180-Day Federal Court Option**
- If OSHA hasn't issued final decision within 180 days, you may remove case to federal district court
- No need to wait for OSHA to complete investigation

### Protected Activity Under SOX

Section 806 (18 U.S.C. § 1514A) protects employees who provide information regarding:
- Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341)
- Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343)
- Bank fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1344)

**Castillo's Protected Activity:**
- Reporting ERISA violations (benefit plan management)
- Disclosing Sedgwick-Schwab claim handling fraud
- Reporting mail/wire fraud in insurance processing
- SOX 302/404 false certifications (internal controls)

### Coordination with EEOC Charge

**Important:** A SOX complaint with OSHA is **separate** from an EEOC charge.
- EEOC handles discrimination/retaliation under Title VII, ADA, etc.
- OSHA handles SOX whistleblower retaliation specifically
- You can file both simultaneously
- Different statutes, different agencies, different remedies

## False Claims Act / Qui Tam (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733)

### Applicability to Castillo's Case

**Critical Analysis Required:** Does the Sedgwick-Schwab scheme involve federal funds?

**Possible Federal Nexus:**
- Federal employee benefit plans
- Medicare Secondary Payer Act violations
- Federal contractor disability programs
- Veterans' benefits administration
- Social Security Disability Insurance coordination
- Federal ERISA enforcement

**If NO federal funds:** False Claims Act does NOT apply.
**If YES federal funds:** FCA may provide strong remedy with whistleblower bounty (15-30% of recovery).

### Pro Se Filing: NO ✗

**YOU CANNOT FILE QUI TAM PRO SE - ATTORNEY REQUIRED**

**Critical Requirement:** To file a qui tam lawsuit under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers **must hire an attorney**. Pro se qui tam filings are not permitted.

### Why Attorney is Required

1. **Complex Procedural Requirements**
   - Seal requirements
   - Evidence disclosure to DOJ
   - Coordination with government investigation
   - Potential intervention by government

2. **Legal Complexity**
   - Sophisticated statute with many elements
   - High pleading standards
   - Extensive case law
   - Potential counterclaims by defendant

3. **Financial Risk**
   - Defendants often file sanctions motions against weak cases
   - Risk of attorney fee awards to defendants
   - Relator may be liable for defendant's costs

### Seal Procedures

**60-Day Minimum Seal:**
- Complaint filed **in camera** (under seal, not public)
- Remains sealed for at least 60 days
- NOT served on defendant during seal period
- Only court and government have access

**Extensions Common:**
- Government routinely requests seal extensions
- Cases may remain under seal for months or years
- Government investigates during seal period

### Filing Requirements

**Simultaneous Submissions:**

1. **Federal District Court Filing**
   - Complaint filed under seal
   - File in district where defendant resides or where violation occurred

2. **Service on Government**
   - Copy of complaint to U.S. Attorney for the district
   - Copy of complaint to Attorney General (DOJ)
   - **Written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information**
   - Service per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(4)

**Government's Role:**

Within 60 days (or extended period), government must:
- Decide whether to intervene (take over the case)
- Conduct its own investigation
- Review evidence provided by whistleblower

**Intervention Outcomes:**

- **Government Intervenes:** DOJ takes primary control; relator remains party
- **Government Declines:** Relator may proceed alone; lower success rate

### Required Elements for FCA Claim

To establish False Claims Act violation, must show:

1. **False or Fraudulent Claim**
   - Claim for payment submitted to U.S. government
   - Claim was false or fraudulent
   - Defendant knew claim was false (or reckless disregard/deliberate ignorance)

2. **Presentment to Government**
   - Claim must be presented to federal government or its agent
   - Direct or indirect submission

3. **Materiality**
   - False statement must be material to government's payment decision

4. **Damages**
   - Government suffered financial loss

**Potential FCA Theories for Castillo's Case (IF federal funds involved):**

- **Medicare Secondary Payer:** Failure to properly coordinate benefits
- **Federal Employee Plans:** Improper claim denials affecting federal employees
- **VA Benefits:** Coordination failures with veterans' benefits
- **SSDI:** Social Security Disability Insurance coordination issues

### Rewards for Whistleblowers (Relators)

If government recovers funds:
- **15-25%** of recovery if government intervenes
- **25-30%** of recovery if relator proceeds alone and prevails

**Treble Damages:** Government recovers 3x actual damages plus penalties.

**Example:** $10 million fraud → $30 million recovery → Relator receives $4.5-9 million

### Finding FCA Counsel

**Contingency Fee Basis:**
Most qui tam attorneys work on contingency (percentage of recovery), meaning no upfront payment required.

**Specialization Important:**
Seek attorneys specializing in:
- False Claims Act litigation
- Qui tam whistleblower cases
- Healthcare fraud (if ERISA/Medicare nexus)
- Government contracts

**Resources:**
- National Whistleblower Center: https://www.whistleblowers.org
- Taxpayers Against Fraud: https://www.taf.org
- State bar association referral services

### Timeline

**No Specific Deadline:**
False Claims Act has a 6-year statute of limitations (with some extensions possible).

**Act Quickly Because:**
- First-to-file rule: Only first whistleblower can bring qui tam action
- Evidence may degrade over time
- Continuing violations extend limitations period
