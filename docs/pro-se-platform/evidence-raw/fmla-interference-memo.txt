INTERNAL MEMORANDUM
TO: File
FROM: Sara Fowler, HR Department
DATE: May 10, 2024
RE: Employee Performance Issue - Marc Castillo

During today's discussion with Marc Castillo regarding his approved FMLA leave,
I reminded him that taking additional leave could be detrimental to his career
advancement within our organization.

While technically protected, we made it clear that future leave requests would
be "noted" in his file.

This memo is for documentation purposes only.

[Signed] Sara Fowler
