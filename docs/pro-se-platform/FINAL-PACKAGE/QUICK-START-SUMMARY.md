- Emotional distress: $150K (4 medical crises)
- Punitive damages: Capped at $300K (statutory limit)

## 🎯 YOUR STRONGEST EVIDENCE

### 1. Sedgwick Metadata Fraud (p < 0.00001, 95% causality)
- Systematic backdating across 15+ documents
- DCN dates don't match file creation dates
- Smoking gun for spoliation sanctions

### 2. Medical Escalation (p = 0.0043, 92% causality)
- 4 hypertensive emergencies correlated with retaliation
- BP spikes same day as manager interactions
- Doctors documented work-related stress

### 3. Temporal Proximity (Days Between Events)
- Retaliation within 7-14 days of protected activities
- First disclosure → First retaliation: 7 days
- Second disclosure → Second retaliation: 7 days
- 7th Circuit: Days/weeks = "highly suggestive" of causation

### 4. Network Sabotage (p < 0.0001, 85% causality)
- 5 targeted "technical issues" blocking work
- Statistical improbability: p < 0.0001
- Pattern: IT issue → missed deadline → performance criticism

### 5. Multiple Federal Statutes
- ADA + FMLA + ERISA + SOX + Constructive Discharge + Spoliation
- Hard to defend all simultaneously
- Jury can find for you on any one

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Evidence Priorities (What System Needs Most)
**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Sedgwick denial letters (all 4 with metadata)
- Medical records (4 ER visits + medication records)
- IT network logs (5 sabotage incidents)
- Performance reviews (before/after disclosures)
- Email communications (Babchuk, Egorov, Bristow, Huffner)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- Audio recordings (HR meetings, benefits calls)
- FMLA requests and responses
- SOX disclosure emails to compliance
- Termination letter and severance offer

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- Company policies
- Training materials
- General correspondence

### Attorney Considerations
**You CAN do pro se for:**
- OSHA SOX complaint (administrative process)
- SEC Form TCR (straightforward online form)
- FBI/DOJ referrals (information sharing)
- Initial filings (before complexity escalates)

**Consider attorney for:**
- FCA qui tam (REQUIRES attorney, cannot file pro se)
- Federal court litigation (complex procedures)
- SEC award application (maximize percentage)
- Settlement negotiations (attorney has leverage)

### Settlement Strategy
**Leverage points:**
- Spoliation evidence (Sedgwick backdating)
- Medical documentation (4 objective crises)
- Multiple statutes (hard to defend all)
- Statistical significance (p-values prove causation)
- Reputational risk (corporate fraud, securities violations)

**Realistic settlement range:** $500K - $2M
