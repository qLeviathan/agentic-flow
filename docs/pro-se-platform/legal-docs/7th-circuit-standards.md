## 1. Summary Judgment Standards

### 1.1 Supreme Court Trilogy

#### Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)

**Citation:** Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)

**Key Holdings:**
- Moving party bears initial burden to identify absence of genuine issue of material fact
- Moving party need not produce evidence negating opponent's claim
- If moving party meets burden, non-moving party must set forth specific facts showing genuine issue for trial
- Summary judgment appropriate where "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law"

**Standard:** "A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." *Id.* at 323.

#### Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986)

**Citation:** Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)

**Key Holdings:**
- Substantive law determines which facts are material
- Only disputes over facts that might affect outcome under governing law preclude summary judgment
- Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted
- Evidence must be viewed in light most favorable to non-moving party
- Court must ask whether "evidence is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law"

**Standard:** "The inquiry performed is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is the need for a trial—whether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." *Id.* at 250.

#### Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986)

**Citation:** Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)

**Key Holdings:**
- Nonmoving party must present affirmative evidence to defeat properly supported motion
- Mere scintilla of evidence insufficient to create genuine issue
- Evidence must be significantly probative
- When record taken as a whole could not lead rational trier of fact to find for non-moving party, no genuine issue for trial exists

**Standard:** "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." *Id.* at 586.

### 1.2 Seventh Circuit Applications

#### Viewing Evidence in Light Most Favorable to Non-Movant

**Payne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, 770 (7th Cir. 2003):**
"A court must construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion is made."

**Patterson v. Chi. Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, 150 F.3d 719, 724 (7th Cir. 1998):**
"We view the record and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party."

#### Credibility Determinations

**Sarsha v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 3 F.3d 1035, 1038 (7th Cir. 1993):**
"Summary judgment may not be granted when there are factual disputes that can be resolved only by a credibility determination, because only a jury may assess the credibility of witnesses."

**Miller v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 997, 1003 (7th Cir. 2000):**
"When opposing parties tell different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment."

#### Drawing Inferences

**Springer v. Durflinger, 518 F.3d 479, 484 (7th Cir. 2008):**
"In determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, we construe the facts strictly against the moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party."

**Outlaw v. Newkirk, 259 F.3d 833, 837 (7th Cir. 2001):**
"Although we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, we will not draw unreasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor."

### 1.3 Application to Castillo Facts

**Plaintiff's Burden:**
- Must point to specific evidence creating genuine dispute of material fact
- Cannot rely solely on allegations in complaint
- Must provide affidavits, depositions, or documentary evidence
- Evidence must be admissible at trial

**Defendant's Motion:**
- Must identify specific portions of record demonstrating no genuine dispute
- Can point to lack of evidence on essential element plaintiff must prove
- Bears burden of showing entitlement to judgment as a matter of law

**Critical Issues for Castillo:**
1. Whether plaintiff can establish prima facie case for each claim
2. Whether credibility determinations remain for jury
3. Whether temporal proximity and other circumstantial evidence creates inference of retaliation
4. Whether plaintiff can demonstrate pretext
5. Whether genuine disputes exist regarding factual causation

---

## 2. ADA Retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 12203)

### 2.1 Statutory Framework

**42 U.S.C. § 12203(a):** "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter."

**42 U.S.C. § 12203(b):** Coercion, intimidation, threats, or interference prohibited.

### 2.2 Prima Facie Case Elements (7th Circuit)

#### Dickerson v. Bd. of Trs. of Cmty. Coll. Dist. No. 522, 657 F.3d 595, 601 (7th Cir. 2011)

**Elements:**
1. Plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity
2. Plaintiff suffered materially adverse action
3. Causal connection between protected activity and adverse action

**Standard:** "A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA by showing that (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action by his employer; and (3) there was a causal connection between the two." *Id.*

#### Tomanovich v. City of Indianapolis, 457 F.3d 656, 663 (7th Cir. 2006)

**Causation Standard:** "We have held that suspicious timing alone may be sufficient to establish the required causal link for purposes of making out a prima facie case of retaliation."

### 2.3 Protected Activity

#### Opposition Clause

**Casna v. City of Loves Park, 574 F.3d 420, 427 (7th Cir. 2009):**
"Protected opposition includes 'informal complaints to management, as well as the filing of formal charges of discrimination.'"

**Requirements:**
- Reasonable, good-faith belief that opposed conduct violated ADA
- Need not prove underlying discrimination actually occurred
- Informal complaints constitute protected activity

#### Participation Clause

**Covers:**
- Filing EEOC charges
- Testifying in investigations
- Participating in discrimination proceedings
- Assisting others in discrimination claims

### 2.4 Materially Adverse Action

#### Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006)

**Standard (adopted by 7th Circuit):** Actions that "might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination."

**Examples in 7th Circuit:**
- Termination (*Dickerson*, 657 F.3d at 601)
- Suspension (*Culver v. Gorman & Co., 416 F.3d 540, 545 (7th Cir. 2005)*)
- Demotion (*Stone v. City of Indianapolis Pub. Utils. Div., 281 F.3d 640, 644 (7th Cir. 2002)*)
- Reduction in pay or benefits
- Constructive discharge

**Not Adverse:**
- Minor schedule changes (*Nichols v. S. Ill. Univ.-Edwardsville, 510 F.3d 772, 780 (7th Cir. 2007)*)
- Lateral transfers without reduced pay (*Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 85 F.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir. 1996)*)

### 2.5 Causal Connection

#### Temporal Proximity

**Strong Inference Cases:**

**Stone v. City of Indianapolis, 281 F.3d 640, 644 (7th Cir. 2002):**
"Suspicious timing alone can be sufficient to establish a causal link for purposes of making out a prima facie case."

**Proximity Periods Recognized:**
- **2 days:** Sufficient (*Loudermilk v. Best Pallet Co., 636 F.3d 312, 315 (7th Cir. 2011)*)
- **3 days:** Sufficient (*Culver v. Gorman & Co., 416 F.3d 540, 546 (7th Cir. 2005)*)
- **2-3 weeks:** Generally sufficient (*Tomanovich*, 457 F.3d at 663-64)
- **3-4 months:** May be sufficient with other evidence (*Burks v. Wis. Dep't of Transp., 464 F.3d 744, 758 (7th Cir. 2006)*)
- **Over 4 months:** Generally insufficient alone (*Culver*, 416 F.3d at 546)

#### Other Circumstantial Evidence

**Scaife v. Cook Cty., 446 F.3d 735, 741-42 (7th Cir. 2006):**
- Pattern of antagonism following protected activity
- Inconsistent reasons for adverse action
- Treating similarly situated employees differently
- Pretextual explanations

### 2.6 Pretext Analysis

#### McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework

**Stage 1:** Plaintiff establishes prima facie case
**Stage 2:** Defendant articulates legitimate, non-retaliatory reason
**Stage 3:** Plaintiff demonstrates reason is pretextual

#### Demonstrating Pretext

**Scaife v. Cook Cty., 446 F.3d 735, 742-43 (7th Cir. 2006):**

**Methods:**
1. Show employer's stated reason has no basis in fact
2. Show stated reason did not actually motivate action
3. Show stated reason insufficient to warrant action

**Evidence of Pretext:**
- Inconsistent explanations
- Deviation from normal procedures
- Different treatment of similarly situated employees
- Shifting justifications
- Proximity to protected activity

#### Ortiz v. Werner Enters., Inc., 834 F.3d 760, 765 (7th Cir. 2016)

**Standard:** "A plaintiff must produce evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the employer's stated reason is a lie, specifically a phony reason for some action—a kind of lie which in turn may allow the jury to infer that the employer's real reason for the action is one prohibited by law."

### 2.7 Mixed-Motive Cases

#### Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 101-02 (2003)

**Standard:** Plaintiff need not prove retaliation was sole reason; sufficient if motivating factor.

**7th Circuit Application:** *Ortiz*, 834 F.3d at 766: "Even if the employer had other, legitimate reasons for its action, if retaliation was a substantial or motivating factor, liability attaches."

### 2.8 Application to Castillo Facts

**Element 1: Protected Activity**
- Plaintiff's accommodation requests constitute protected opposition
- Requesting reasonable accommodations for disability
- Informal complaints about disability discrimination
- Filing EEOC charge (participation clause)

**Element 2: Adverse Actions**
- Termination clearly materially adverse
- Constructive discharge conditions
- Denial of accommodations may qualify
- Changes in work conditions if substantial

**Element 3: Causal Connection**
- Timeline from accommodation requests to termination
- Temporal proximity analysis crucial
- Pattern of treatment following requests
- Statements by management linking accommodation to adverse treatment

**Pretext Evidence:**
- Inconsistent reasons for termination
- Deviation from progressive discipline
- Different treatment of non-disabled employees
- False allegations or exaggerated misconduct
- Timing and sequence of events

**Key Factual Disputes:**
- Whether accommodation requests preceded adverse actions
- Exact timeline of events
- Credibility of employer's stated reasons
- Whether similarly situated employees treated differently
- Whether discipline proportionate to alleged misconduct

## 3. FMLA Interference & Retaliation (29 U.S.C. § 2615)

### 3.1 Statutory Framework

**29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1):** Right to 12 weeks leave for serious health condition

**29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2):** Right to return to equivalent position

**29 U.S.C. § 2615(b):** Maintenance of benefits during leave

**29 CFR § 825.220(c):** Anti-retaliation provision

### 3.2 FMLA Interference Claims

#### Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89 (2002)

**Standard:** "The Act creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages 'against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction' should that employer 'interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of FMLA rights.'"

#### Elements (7th Circuit)

**Burnett v. LFW Inc., 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006):**

1. Plaintiff eligible for FMLA protections
2. Employer covered by FMLA
3. Plaintiff entitled to leave under FMLA
4. Plaintiff provided sufficient notice of intent to take leave
5. Employer denied FMLA benefits to which plaintiff entitled

**Standard:** "Unlike retaliation claims, interference claims do not require proof of discriminatory animus. It is enough that the employer's actions interfere with the employee's rights under the FMLA." *Id.* at 477.

### 3.3 FMLA Retaliation Claims

#### Bunn v. Khoury Enters., Inc., 753 F.3d 676, 682 (7th Cir. 2014)

**Prima Facie Elements:**
1. Plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity
2. Plaintiff suffered materially adverse action
3. Causal connection between protected activity and adverse action

**Distinction from Interference:** "Unlike an interference claim, a retaliation claim requires the employee to show that the employer took the adverse action at least in part because the employee exercised his or her FMLA rights." *Id.*

### 3.4 Protected Activity Under FMLA

**Covers:**
- Requesting FMLA leave
- Taking FMLA leave
- Opposing FMLA violations
- Participating in FMLA proceedings
- Requesting information about FMLA rights

**Scruggs v. Carrier Corp., 688 F.3d 821, 824 (7th Cir. 2012):**
"An employee engages in protected activity when he requests leave that would qualify under the FMLA, whether or not he specifically mentions the FMLA."

### 3.5 Notice Requirements

#### 29 CFR § 825.302 - Employee Notice

**General Rule:** Employee must provide sufficient information for employer to determine leave may be FMLA-qualifying

**Sufficient Notice:**
- Need not mention "FMLA" specifically (*Scruggs*, 688 F.3d at 824)
- Must indicate need for leave due to serious health condition
- Must provide enough information for employer to inquire further

**Brenneman v. MedCentral Health Sys., 366 F.3d 412, 420 (6th Cir. 2004)** (adopted by 7th Circuit):
"[A]n employee need only give his employer enough information to show that he may need FMLA leave."

#### 29 CFR § 825.300(d) - Employer Knowledge

**Darst v. Interstate Brands Corp., 512 F.3d 903, 909 (7th Cir. 2008):**
"The question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee's request to take time off for a serious health condition."

### 3.6 Causation Standards

#### Direct Evidence vs. Indirect Evidence

**Direct Evidence Standard:**

**Rogers v. City of Chi., 320 F.3d 748, 753 (7th Cir. 2003):**
"Direct evidence essentially requires an admission by the decision-maker that the adverse action was taken on account of the protected activity."

**Indirect Evidence - McDonnell Douglas Framework:**

**Lewis v. Sch. Dist. # 70, 523 F.3d 730, 741 (7th Cir. 2008):**
Temporal proximity plus pattern of antagonism can establish prima facie case.

#### Temporal Proximity in FMLA Cases

**Close Proximity Sufficient:**
- **Days to weeks:** Generally sufficient (*Bunn*, 753 F.3d at 683)
- **One month:** Strong evidence (*King v. Preferred Tech. Grp., 166 F.3d 887, 892 (7th Cir. 1999)*)
- **Two months:** May be sufficient with other evidence
- **Several months:** Requires additional suspicious circumstances

**Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 703 F.3d 966, 974 (7th Cir. 2012):**
"Close timing between protected activity and adverse action can justify an inference of retaliation."

### 3.7 Honest Belief Defense

#### Kariotis v. Navistar Int'l Transp. Corp., 131 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 1997)

**Standard:** "If the employer honestly believes in the nondiscriminatory reason it offers to explain the discharge, the employer will prevail—even if the reason is foolish or trivial or even baseless."

**Limitation:** Honest belief must be reasonable and supported by particularized facts

**Skiba v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 884 F.3d 708, 723 (7th Cir. 2018):**
"But this doctrine does not give employers carte blanche to rely on any reason they choose. The belief must be honest and reasonable."

### 3.8 Cat's Paw Theory

#### Staub v. Proctor Hosp., 562 U.S. 411, 422 (2011)

**Holding:** Employer liable when biased subordinate's actions cause adverse employment decision by unbiased decision-maker

**Standard:** "If a supervisor performs an act motivated by [prohibited] animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable."

**7th Circuit Application - Silverman v. Bd. of Educ., 637 F.3d 729, 738 (7th Cir. 2011):**
"The cat's paw theory allows a plaintiff to establish that an employment decision was made 'because of' a protected characteristic even where the formal decision-maker had no discriminatory intent, by showing that an employee with such intent caused the adverse action."

### 3.9 Interference vs. Retaliation Distinction

#### Key Differences

**Interference Claims:**
- No proof of discriminatory intent required
- Need only show denial of FMLA benefits
- Burden does not shift to employer
- Focus on whether employee received FMLA entitlements

**Retaliation Claims:**
- Requires proof of retaliatory animus
- McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting applies
- Must show adverse action taken because of FMLA exercise
- Focus on employer's motivation

**Lyszczasz v. Banicki, 726 F.3d 857, 862 (7th Cir. 2013):**
"To prove FMLA retaliation, an employee must show that her employer took an adverse job action against her because she exercised rights protected by the FMLA. By contrast, to succeed on an FMLA interference claim, an employee must show only that she was denied rights guaranteed under the Act."

### 3.10 Remedies and Damages

#### 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)

**Available Relief:**
- Lost wages and benefits
- Interest on lost wages
- Equitable relief (reinstatement, promotion)
- Liquidated damages (double damages) for willful violations
- Attorney's fees and costs

**Keller v. Miri Microsystems LLC, 781 F.3d 799, 812 (6th Cir. 2015)** (persuasive in 7th Circuit):
"Liquidated damages are the norm, and employers can avoid them only by proving that their FMLA violations were in good faith."

### 3.11 Application to Castillo Facts

**Interference Claim Analysis:**

**Element 1: Eligibility**
- Plaintiff employed by covered employer
- Worked 1,250 hours in preceding 12 months
- Serious health condition qualifying for FMLA

**Element 2: Notice**

- Did plaintiff communicate serious health condition?
- Did employer have actual or constructive knowledge?

**Element 3: Denial of Benefits**
- Was leave improperly denied or cut short?
- Were benefits maintained during leave?
- Was plaintiff restored to equivalent position?
- Constructive discharge as FMLA interference

**Retaliation Claim Analysis:**

**Protected Activity:**
- Requests for FMLA leave
- Taking FMLA leave
- Complaints about FMLA violations

**Adverse Action:**
- Termination
- Constructive discharge
- Denial of benefits

**Causal Connection:**
- Timeline from FMLA requests to termination
- Temporal proximity
- Pattern of hostility following FMLA usage
- Statements linking FMLA use to adverse treatment
- Deviation from policy following FMLA leave

**Pretext Evidence:**
- Inconsistent reasons for termination
- False accusations timing to FMLA leave
- Different treatment of employees not using FMLA
- Departure from progressive discipline
- Cat's paw liability if biased supervisors involved

**Key Factual Disputes:**
- Adequacy of FMLA notice provided
- Employer's knowledge of FMLA-qualifying condition
- Whether termination motivated by FMLA usage
- Legitimacy of stated reasons for termination
- Whether honest belief defense applies

---

## 4. ERISA § 510 (29 U.S.C. § 1140)

### 4.1 Statutory Framework

**29 U.S.C. § 1140:** "It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan... or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan."

### 4.2 Elements of § 510 Claim (7th Circuit)

#### Dister v. Cont'l Grp., Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1988) (adopted by 7th Circuit)

**Prima Facie Case:**
1. Prohibited employer conduct
2. Taken for purpose of interfering with protected right

**Kross v. Western Elec. Co., 701 F.2d 1238, 1244 (7th Cir. 1983):**
"Section 510 prohibits employers from discharging employees for the 'purpose of interfering' with their rights under ERISA plans."

### 4.3 Specific Intent Requirement

#### Teumer v. Gen. Motors Corp., 34 F.3d 542, 545 (7th Cir. 1994)

**Standard:** "To establish a violation of section 510, a plaintiff must show specific intent to violate ERISA—that is, that the employer took adverse action against the employee for the specific purpose of interfering with his benefits."

**Key Principle:** General cost-cutting or business decisions insufficient; must show purpose to interfere with specific employee's benefits.

#### Phelps v. Field Real Estate Co., 991 F.2d 645, 649 (10th Cir. 1993) (persuasive)

**Distinction:** "The critical distinction... is between a decision based on a general consideration of benefits costs and a decision specifically directed at interfering with the vesting rights of a particular employee or group of employees."

### 4.4 Protected Rights Under § 510

**Covered Rights:**
- Pension benefit accrual
- Health insurance benefits
- Disability benefits
- Life insurance benefits
- Severance pay plans
- Stock option plans

**Gavalik v. Continental Can Co., 812 F.2d 834, 852 (3d Cir. 1987):**
"Section 510 protects not only vested benefits but also benefits to which the employee 'may become entitled.'"

### 4.5 Proof of Discriminatory Intent

#### Direct Evidence

**Diefenbach v. Sheridan Health Care Ctr., 815 F.3d 938, 945 (7th Cir. 2016):**
"Direct evidence would be a statement or document explicitly stating that an employment decision was made to interfere with ERISA benefits."

**Examples:**
- Statements about avoiding benefit payments
- Documents showing cost-savings from termination
- Emails discussing timing to prevent vesting

#### Circumstantial Evidence

**Habersetzer v. Nestle Purina Petcare Co., 972 F.3d 792, 799 (7th Cir. 2020):**

**Relevant Factors:**
1. Proximity of termination to benefit vesting or qualification
2. Inconsistent or pretextual reasons for termination
3. Evidence of cost-consciousness regarding benefits
4. Pattern of terminating employees before benefits vest
5. Deviation from standard procedures

**Timing Analysis:**

**Highly Suspicious:**
- Termination days/weeks before pension vesting (*Kross*, 701 F.2d at 1245)
- Discharge shortly before qualification for benefits
- Immediate termination after claim filed

**Less Suspicious:**
- Termination years from vesting
- Long period between benefit claim and termination

### 4.6 Causation Standards

#### Edwards v. A.H. Cornell & Son, Inc., 610 F.3d 217, 222 (3d Cir. 2010) (persuasive)

**But-For Causation:** "ERISA § 510 requires but-for causation, meaning the plaintiff must show that the discriminatory reason made the difference between the action taken and one not taken."

**Multiple Motives:** Prohibited purpose need not be sole reason, but must be determining factor.

### 4.7 Pretext in § 510 Cases

#### Dister v. Continental Group, Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1116 (2d Cir. 1988)

**Pretext Showing:**
- False reasons for termination
- Inconsistent explanations
- Lack of documentation for stated reasons
- Deviation from established procedures
- Timing proximity to benefit events

**Burden:** Once plaintiff shows proximity and suspicious circumstances, burden shifts to employer to produce legitimate, specific reason.

### 4.8 Remedies Under § 510

#### 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)

**Available Relief:**
- Equitable relief (reinstatement, benefit restoration)
- Make-whole relief
- Lost wages
- Benefits wrongfully denied

**Limitation:** No compensatory or punitive damages (*Varity Corp. v. Howe*, 516 U.S. 489, 515 (1996))

**7th Circuit - Bowerman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 226 F.3d 574, 591 (7th Cir. 2000):**
"Remedies under § 502(a)(3) are limited to equitable relief."

### 4.9 Comparison to Other Retaliation Claims

**Distinguishing Features:**

| Feature | § 510 | Title VII/ADA | FMLA |
|---------|-------|---------------|------|
| Intent | Specific intent required | Mixed-motive accepted | Mixed-motive accepted |
| Causation | But-for causation | Motivating factor | Motivating factor |
| Damages | Equitable only | Legal & equitable | Legal & equitable |
| Timing | Critical factor | Important factor | Important factor |

### 4.10 Application to Castillo Facts

**Element 1: Prohibited Conduct**
- Termination constitutes prohibited conduct
- Constructive discharge qualifies
- Denial of benefits during employment

**Element 2: Specific Intent to Interfere**

**Timing Analysis:**
- When was plaintiff terminated relative to benefit vesting?
- Proximity to qualification for disability benefits?
- Timing relative to health insurance claims?

**Cost-Consciousness Evidence:**
- Statements about cost of plaintiff's benefits
- Documents showing financial motivation
- Comparison to other terminations
- Pattern of terminating high-cost employees

**Protected Benefits at Issue:**
- Pension/401(k) vesting schedule
- Health insurance continuation
- Disability benefits eligibility
- Workers' compensation claims
- Severance pay entitlement

**Pretext Evidence:**
- False reasons for termination
- Inconsistent justifications
- Proximity to benefit qualification
- Different treatment of similarly situated employees
- Deviation from progressive discipline

**Causation:**
- But-for test: Would termination have occurred absent benefits consideration?
- Direct evidence of intent (emails, statements about benefits costs)
- Circumstantial evidence from timing and pattern

**Key Factual Disputes:**
- Actual reason for termination
- Knowledge of benefits status
- Financial motivation behind employment decisions
- Whether legitimate business reasons exist
- Credibility of stated reasons

## 6. Constructive Discharge

### 6.1 Supreme Court Standard

#### Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141 (2004)

**Definition:** "A constructive discharge occurs when an employer, rather than discharging an employee directly, intentionally creates intolerable working conditions with the intent to force the employee to quit."

**Two-Part Test:**
1. Working conditions so intolerable that reasonable person would feel compelled to resign
2. Employer created intolerable conditions with intent to force resignation (or reasonably foreseeable consequence)

**Standard:** "The plaintiff must show working conditions 'so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.'" *Id.* at 134.

### 6.2 Seventh Circuit Applications

#### Tutman v. WBBM-TV, Inc., 209 F.3d 1044, 1049 (7th Cir. 2000)

**Standard:** "To prevail on a constructive discharge claim, an employee must show that working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign."

**Objective Test:** "The employee must prove an objective level of intolerability; the test is not whether the employee subjectively felt forced to quit."

#### Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F.3d 1446, 1458 (7th Cir. 1994)

**Factors to Consider:**
1. Demotion
2. Reduction in salary
3. Reduction in job responsibilities
4. Reassignment to menial or degrading work
5. Reassignment to work under younger supervisor
6. Badgering, harassment, or humiliation calculated to encourage resignation
7. Offers of early retirement that would make employee's continued work intolerable

### 6.3 Intolerable Working Conditions

#### Objective Standard

**Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993):**
"An objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is another."

**Quantified in 7th Circuit:**

**Chapin v. Fort-Rohr Motors, Inc., 621 F.3d 673, 676-77 (7th Cir. 2010):**
"Ordinarily, a single isolated incident will not be enough to support a claim of constructive discharge... Rather, the plaintiff must show that working conditions deteriorated over time."

#### Examples of Intolerable Conditions

**Sufficient:**
- Systematic harassment and humiliation (*Logan v. Kautex Textron N. Am., 259 F.3d 635 (6th Cir. 2001)*)
- Demotion combined with harassment (*Dey*, 28 F.3d at 1459)
- Pattern of false accusations (*Rabinovitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 490 (7th Cir. 1996)*)
- Significant reduction in responsibilities and pay

**Insufficient:**
- Minor changes in working conditions
- Personality conflicts
- Ordinary workplace friction
- Isolated incidents of criticism

### 6.4 Intent Requirement

#### Suders Standard in 7th Circuit

**Haywood v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 323 F.3d 524, 531 (7th Cir. 2003):**
"The employer must intentionally create intolerable working conditions with the desire to force the employee out, or it must be obvious to the employer that the intolerable conditions will cause the employee to resign."

**Two Ways to Satisfy Intent:**
1. **Direct Intent:** Employer deliberately creates conditions to force resignation
2. **Constructive Intent:** Resignation is reasonably foreseeable consequence of employer's actions

#### Reasonable Foreseeability

**Rabinovitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 490 (7th Cir. 1996):**
"Intent can be shown by demonstrating that resignation was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the employer's actions."

**Evidence of Intent:**
- Statements about wanting employee to quit
- Pattern of escalating adverse actions
- Creation of impossible work situations
- Removal of essential job functions
- Public humiliation or degradation

### 6.5 Timeline and Deliberation

#### Reasonable Time to Decide

**Bristow v. Daily Press, Inc., 770 F.2d 1251, 1255 (4th Cir. 1985)** (persuasive):
"A constructive discharge cannot be established merely by showing that the employee quit after an adverse employment decision... There must be aggravating factors."

**Drake v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 134 F.3d 878, 886 (7th Cir. 1998):**
"An employee who quits immediately after learning of intolerable conditions strengthens claim that conditions were truly intolerable."

**Timing Considerations:**
- Immediate resignation: Strong evidence of intolerability
- Delayed resignation: May suggest conditions tolerable
- Continuing deterioration: Supports constructive discharge
- Single incident resignation: Generally insufficient

### 6.6 Aggravating Factors

**Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F.2d 340, 344 (10th Cir. 1986)** (persuasive):

**Relevant Considerations:**
1. Pattern of adverse actions
2. Public humiliation
3. Escalating severity
4. Duration of intolerable conditions
5. Employer's knowledge of effect on employee
6. Lack of corrective action despite complaints

### 6.7 Constructive Discharge in Retaliation Cases

#### Heightened Standard

**Suders, 542 U.S. at 148:**
"Constructive discharge is distinct from hostile work environment. It requires something more than actionable level of harassment."

**Comparison:**
- **Hostile Work Environment:** Severe or pervasive harassment
- **Constructive Discharge:** Conditions so extreme that reasonable person compelled to resign

**Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 555 (2016):**
"A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leave and the employer's involvement in that decision."

### 6.8 Burden of Proof

#### Plaintiff's Burden

**Rabinovitz, 89 F.3d at 489:**
Plaintiff must prove by preponderance of evidence:
1. Objectively intolerable working conditions
2. Employer's intent (direct or constructive)
3. Causal connection to protected activity (in retaliation cases)

#### Employer Defenses

**Potential Defenses:**
- Conditions not objectively intolerable
- No intent to force resignation
- Legitimate business reasons for changes
- Employee unreasonably sensitive
- Adequate remedial measures taken

### 6.9 Relationship to Underlying Claims

#### Constructive Discharge as Vehicle

**Drake, 134 F.3d at 884:**
"Constructive discharge itself is not a separate cause of action. Rather, it is a means of establishing an adverse employment action in a discrimination or retaliation claim."

**Integration with Claims:**
- **ADA Retaliation:** Constructive discharge = materially adverse action
- **FMLA:** Constructive discharge = interference/retaliation
- **ERISA § 510:** Constructive discharge = prohibited conduct
- **SOX:** Constructive discharge = unfavorable personnel action

### 6.10 Mitigation and Resignation Decision

#### Duty to Complain

**Suders, 542 U.S. at 148:**
"If employer has effective anti-harassment policy and employee unreasonably fails to use it, employer may raise affirmative defense."

**Limitation:** Defense unavailable when supervisor's actions constitute constructive discharge.

#### Alternatives to Resignation

**Consideration of:**
- Whether employee sought internal remedies
- Whether employee gave employer chance to correct
- Whether employee explored transfer opportunities
- Whether resignation truly only option

### 6.11 Application to Castillo Facts

**Element 1: Intolerable Working Conditions**

- Pattern of adverse actions:
  - False accusations
  - Disciplinary actions
  - Denial of accommodations
  - Hostile treatment
  - Public humiliation
  - Reduction in responsibilities
  - Threats of termination

**Duration and Escalation:**
- How long did conditions persist?
- Did conditions worsen over time?
- Were conditions continuous or isolated incidents?

**Comparison to Reasonable Person:**
- Would reasonable person in plaintiff's position feel compelled to resign?
- Consider plaintiff's protected class status
- Consider plaintiff's vulnerability (disability, family responsibilities)

**Element 2: Employer Intent**

**Direct Evidence:**
- Statements about wanting plaintiff to quit
- Comments about "making life difficult"
- Explicit threats of termination
- Creation of impossible situations

**Constructive Intent:**
- Was resignation reasonably foreseeable consequence?
- Did employer know effect of actions on plaintiff?
- Pattern suggesting deliberate strategy
- Escalating severity of actions

**Element 3: Causal Connection**

**Linking to Protected Activity:**
- Timeline from protected activity to deteriorating conditions
- Pattern of retaliation following:
  - Disability accommodation requests
  - FMLA leave usage
  - Benefit claims
  - Whistleblowing disclosures

**Pretext Analysis:**
- Were stated reasons for adverse actions legitimate?
- Inconsistent or shifting explanations
- Different treatment compared to others

**Element 4: Timeline of Resignation**

**Resignation Decision:**
- How soon after conditions became intolerable did plaintiff resign?
- Did plaintiff seek internal remedies before resigning?
- Was resignation hasty or deliberate?
- Documentation of intolerable conditions before resignation

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Multiple adverse actions in succession
- Public humiliation or degradation
- Removal of essential job functions
- False accusations of misconduct
- Denial of accommodations while ill
- Threats related to protected activity

**Key Factual Disputes:**
- Severity and duration of conditions
- Whether conditions objectively intolerable
- Employer's intent and knowledge
- Plaintiff's attempts to remedy situation
- Whether resignation truly compelled
- Timing and circumstances of resignation
- Whether employer took corrective action

**Integration with Other Claims:**
- Constructive discharge strengthens retaliation claims
- Shows ultimate adverse action
- Demonstrates severity of retaliation
- Supports damages claims for lost employment

## 7. Spoliation Sanctions (Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2))

### 7.1 Federal Rule Framework

#### Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) - Failure to Preserve ESI

**Rule 37(e)(1) - Prejudice-Based Sanctions:**
"If electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:

(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or

(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation may:
    (A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;
    (B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or
    (C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment."

### 7.2 Duty to Preserve

#### Trigger for Preservation Duty

**Seventh Circuit Standard:**

**Bracey v. Grondin, 712 F.3d 1012, 1018 (7th Cir. 2013):**
"A party's preservation obligation attaches when the party reasonably anticipates litigation."

**Reasonable Anticipation:**
- Receipt of demand letter
- Filing of EEOC charge
- Threat of litigation
- Internal complaint raising legal claims
- Knowledge of investigation

**Micron Tech., Inc. v. Rambus Inc., 645 F.3d 1311, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2011):**
"A party need not have actual notice of litigation to trigger the duty to preserve; a party's awareness of probable litigation is sufficient."

#### Scope of Preservation Duty

**Reasonable Steps Required:**

**John B. v. Goetz, 531 F.3d 448, 459 (6th Cir. 2008):**
"The duty to preserve extends to relevant documents (including ESI) which a party knows or reasonably should know are relevant in the action, reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence, reasonably likely to be requested during discovery, or the subject of a pending discovery request."

**Types of ESI Subject to Preservation:**
- Emails
- Text messages
- Instant messages
- Social media communications
- Electronic documents
- Databases
- Metadata
- Server logs
- Backup tapes

### 7.3 Three-Tier Analysis Under Rule 37(e)

#### Tier 1: Threshold Requirements (All Cases)

**Must Establish:**
1. ESI should have been preserved
2. Lost because party failed to take reasonable steps
3. Cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery

**Bracey, 712 F.3d at 1018:**
"Without a showing that the duty to preserve was triggered, there can be no finding of spoliation."

#### Tier 2: Prejudice Standard (Rule 37(e)(1))

**Requirements:**
- Prejudice to opposing party from loss
- Sanctions no greater than necessary to cure prejudice

**Available Sanctions:**
- Additional discovery
- Adverse inference jury instruction (limited)
- Attorney's fees
- Costs
- Evidentiary preclusion

**Gomez v. Singletary, No. 15-cv-5307, 2017 WL 1957782, at *4 (N.D. Ill. May 11, 2017):**
"Prejudice means that the missing evidence had some probative value and the loss affects the claiming party's ability to prove its case."

#### Tier 3: Intent to Deprive (Rule 37(e)(2))

**Heightened Standard:**
- Party acted with intent to deprive opponent of information's use
- Most severe sanctions available

**Available Sanctions:**
- Adverse inference presumption
- Mandatory jury instruction
- Default judgment
- Dismissal

**CAT3, LLC v. Black Lineage, Inc., 164 F. Supp. 3d 488, 495 (S.D.N.Y. 2016):**
"Intent to deprive requires more than negligence or even gross negligence. It requires a showing that the destruction was deliberate and in bad faith."

### 7.4 Intent to Deprive Standard

#### Seventh Circuit Analysis

**Keithley v. Homestore.com, Inc., 736 F.3d 1030, 1040 (9th Cir. 2013)** (persuasive in 7th Circuit):
"To prove intent, a party must establish that the spoliator acted willfully, and not merely negligently or even grossly negligently."

**Evidence of Intent:**

**Direct Evidence:**
- Admissions of intentional destruction
- Emails discussing document destruction
- Instructions to delete evidence
- Concealment of destruction

**Circumstantial Evidence:**
- Destruction after litigation anticipated
- Violation of document retention policies
- Selective destruction of harmful documents
- Pattern of non-preservation
- Implausible explanations for loss

### 7.5 Adverse Inference Instruction

#### Pre-2015 Common Law (Still Persuasive)

**Residential Funding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d 99, 108 (2d Cir. 2002):**

**Requirements for Adverse Inference:**
1. Party having control over evidence had obligation to preserve it
2. Destruction occurred with culpable state of mind
3. Destroyed evidence was relevant to claim or defense

**Culpable State of Mind Spectrum:**
- Ordinary negligence: Insufficient
- Gross negligence: May be sufficient for lesser sanctions
- Intentional destruction: Supports adverse inference
- Bad faith: Strongest case for severe sanctions

#### Post-2015 Rule 37(e) Framework

**Sanctions Under 37(e)(1) (Prejudice):**
- Curative measures only
- Limited adverse inference instructions to cure prejudice
- Cannot include presumptions or mandatory findings

**Sanctions Under 37(e)(2) (Intent):**
- Can presume information unfavorable
- Can instruct jury may or must presume unfavorable
- Can dismiss or default

### 7.6 Severe Sanctions (Dismissal/Default)

#### Standards for Dismissal

**Marrocco v. Gen. Motors Corp., 966 F.2d 220, 224 (7th Cir. 1992):**

**Factors for Dismissal Sanction:**
1. Willfulness of non-compliant party
2. Prejudice to opponent
3. History of dilatory conduct
4. Effectiveness of lesser sanctions
5. Meritoriousness of claims and defenses

**Prohibition:** Dismissal/default only with intent to deprive under Rule 37(e)(2)

### 7.7 Categories of Spoliation Conduct

#### Intentional Destruction

**Bad Faith Examples:**
- Destroying documents after litigation hold issued
- Deleting emails related to disputed events
- Fabricating reasons for destruction
- Selective preservation of favorable documents

#### Negligent Loss

**Lesser Culpability:**
- Failure to implement litigation hold
- Inadvertent deletion per routine policy
- Insufficient preservation procedures
- Lost through employee departure

**Sanctions:** Limited to measures curing prejudice (Rule 37(e)(1))

#### Routine Destruction

**Good Faith Defense:**

**Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 217 (S.D.N.Y. 2003):**
"Once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it must suspend its routine document retention/destruction policy and put in place a 'litigation hold.'"

**Key Issue:** Whether routine destruction continued after duty to preserve triggered

### 7.8 Electronically Stored Information Specific Issues

#### Metadata Preservation

**Williams v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 230 F.R.D. 640, 655 (D. Kan. 2005):**
"Metadata is an integral part of ESI and should be preserved along with substantive content."

#### Text Messages and Instant Messages

**Gatto v. United Air Lines, Inc., 233 F.R.D. 445, 467 (D.N.J. 2013):**
"Text messages are ESI subject to preservation obligations."

**Common Issues:**
- Auto-deletion settings
- Personal device usage
- BYOD policies
- Third-party platforms

#### Social Media

**Allied Concrete Co. v. Lester, 285 Va. 295, 305 (2013):**
"Social media content relevant to litigation must be preserved."

### 7.9 Litigation Hold Requirements

#### Implementing Effective Hold

**Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 229 F.R.D. 422, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2004):**

**Required Steps:**
1. Issue written litigation hold notice
2. Identify relevant custodians and data sources
3. Suspend automatic deletion processes
4. Communicate hold to IT personnel
5. Monitor compliance with hold
6. Re-issue hold periodically

#### Notice to Employees

**Phillip M. Adams & Assocs., LLC v. Dell, Inc., No. 09-2904, 2013 WL 6331853, at *4 (D. Utah Dec. 5, 2013):**
"Litigation hold must clearly communicate scope of preservation duty and seriousness of obligation."

### 7.10 Proportionality Considerations

#### Rule 37(e) Advisory Committee Notes

**Reasonableness Standard:**
"The extent of preservation required depends on the circumstances of each case, including the sophistication of the parties and their counsel, the nature and extent of the litigation, and the importance of the information."

**Factors:**
- Burden vs. benefit of preservation
- Accessibility of information
- Costs of preservation
- Significance to case
- Likelihood of use

### 7.11 Proving Spoliation

#### Plaintiff's Burden

**Must Show:**
1. Defendant had duty to preserve
2. Defendant destroyed evidence in bad faith (for 37(e)(2) sanctions)

**Harkabi v. SanDisk Corp., 275 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1309 (D. Utah 2017):**
"The moving party bears the burden of establishing that the responding party spoliated evidence."

#### Evidence of Spoliation

**Direct Evidence:**
- Admissions of destruction
- Emails about deleting evidence

- Was litigation hold issued?
- When was hold issued relative to duty trigger?
- Scope of hold adequate?
- Communication to custodians?
- IT systems suspended deletion?
- Compliance monitoring?

**Prejudice Analysis (Rule 37(e)(1)):**

**Relevance of Lost Information:**
- Would missing emails show retaliatory intent?
- Would text messages reveal discriminatory animus?
- Would deleted documents undermine stated reasons?
- Would lost data prove pretext?

**Ability to Prove Case:**
- Can plaintiff prove retaliation without missing evidence?
- Are there alternative sources?
- How critical was lost information?

**Curative Measures:**
- Additional depositions
- Third-party subpoenas
- Limited adverse inference
- Attorney's fees

**Intent to Deprive Analysis (Rule 37(e)(2)):**

**Direct Evidence of Intent:**
- Admissions about destroying evidence
- Emails instructing deletion
- Suspicious timing of deletions
- Concealment of destruction

**Circumstantial Evidence:**
- Destruction after litigation hold
- Selective preservation/destruction
- Violation of retention policies
- Implausible explanations (e.g., "computer crashed")
- Pattern of non-compliance

**Severe Sanctions Analysis:**

**If Intent Established, Consider:**
1. **Adverse Inference Presumption:** Instruct jury to presume lost evidence unfavorable to defendant
2. **Mandatory Jury Instruction:** Require jury to presume evidence unfavorable
3. **Dismissal/Default:** Only if destruction fundamentally undermines case

**Key Factual Disputes:**

**Timeline:**
- When did duty to preserve arise?
- When were documents destroyed?
- When was litigation hold issued?

**Reasonableness:**
- Were preservation steps adequate?
- Was destruction pursuant to policy?
- Were custodians properly notified?

**Intent:**
- Willful destruction vs. negligence?
- Bad faith vs. good faith?
- Selective vs. uniform destruction?

**Prejudice:**
- How relevant was lost information?
- Can other evidence substitute?
- How does loss affect plaintiff's case?

**Specific ESI Categories:**

1. **Emails:** Gaps in chains, deleted messages about plaintiff
2. **Text Messages:** Conversations between supervisors about plaintiff
3. **HR Files:** Missing investigation documents, notes from meetings
4. **Benefits Records:** Deleted communications about costs
5. **Fraud Reports:** Missing documentation of whistleblower complaints

**Strategic Considerations:**

**Spoliation Motion Benefits:**
- Adverse inference aids in proving retaliation/discrimination
- Shifts burden to defendant
- Demonstrates consciousness of guilt
- May lead to settlement leverage

**Required Showing:**
- Detailed proffer of what was lost
- Evidence of when duty arose
- Proof of inadequate preservation
- Demonstration of prejudice or intent

## 8. RICO Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d))

### 8.1 Statutory Framework

**18 U.S.C. § 1962(d):** "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section."

**Underlying RICO Violations:**

**§ 1962(a):** Income derived from racketeering
**§ 1962(b):** Acquisition of interest in enterprise through racketeering
**§ 1962(c):** Conducting affairs of enterprise through pattern of racketeering activity
**§ 1962(d):** Conspiracy to commit any of the above

### 8.2 Elements of RICO Conspiracy (7th Circuit)

#### United States v. Neopolitan, 791 F.2d 489, 494-95 (7th Cir. 1986)

**Elements:**
1. Existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce
2. Defendant knowingly and willfully agreed to conduct or participate in enterprise affairs
3. Through commission of two or more predicate acts constituting pattern of racketeering activity

**Standard:** "A RICO conspiracy requires only that the defendant agree to the overall objective of the conspiracy, not that he agree to commit each predicate act." *Id.*

### 8.3 Enterprise Requirement

#### 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) - Definition

"'Enterprise' includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."

#### Two Types of Enterprises

**Legal Entity Enterprise:**
- Corporation
- Partnership
- LLC
- Association

**Association-in-Fact Enterprise:**
- Group of individuals
- No formal structure required
- Must have common purpose

#### Association-in-Fact Requirements (7th Circuit)

**United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 665 (8th Cir. 1982)** (adopted by 7th Circuit):

**Elements:**
1. Common or shared purpose
2. Relationship among associates
3. Longevity sufficient to permit associates to pursue enterprise's purpose
4. Structure distinct from pattern of racketeering

**Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 946 (2009):**
"An association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose."

#### Enterprise vs. Pattern Distinction

**United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583 (1981):**
"The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts."

**Critical Requirement:** Enterprise must have existence separate from pattern of racketeering acts

### 8.4 Pattern of Racketeering Activity

#### 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) - Definition

"'Pattern of racketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after [October 15, 1970] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."

#### Continuity Plus Relationship Test

**H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989):**

**Two Requirements:**
1. **Relationship:** Predicate acts related to each other
2. **Continuity:** Acts amount to or pose threat of continued criminal activity

**Relationship:**
- Same or similar purposes
- Same or similar results
- Same or similar participants
- Same or similar victims
- Same or similar methods of commission

**Continuity:**
- **Closed-ended:** Series of related predicates extending over substantial period
- **Open-ended:** Threat that racketeering activity will continue into future

#### Seventh Circuit Pattern Standards

**Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 975 (7th Cir. 1986):**
"To constitute a pattern, the predicate acts must be related and must amount to or pose a threat of continuing criminal activity."

**Relationship Analysis:**

**Slaney v. Int'l Amateur Athletic Fed'n, 244 F.3d 580, 597 (7th Cir. 2001):**
"The predicate acts must have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise be interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."

**Continuity Analysis:**

**Superior Bank FSB v. Golding, 195 F.3d 443, 448 (7th Cir. 1999):**
"Close-ended continuity requires a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time, while open-ended continuity is established by proving a threat of continuity."

**Substantial Period:**
- Few weeks: Generally insufficient
- Several months: May be sufficient
- Years: Clearly sufficient

### 8.5 Predicate Acts - Mail and Wire Fraud

#### 18 U.S.C. § 1341 - Mail Fraud

**Elements:**
1. Scheme to defraud or obtain property by false pretenses
2. Use of U.S. mail to execute scheme
3. Specific intent to defraud

**United States v. Janian, 725 F.3d 668, 677 (7th Cir. 2013):**
"Mail fraud requires proof of (1) a scheme to defraud and (2) the mailing of a letter for the purpose of executing the scheme."

#### 18 U.S.C. § 1343 - Wire Fraud

**Elements:**
1. Scheme to defraud or obtain property by false pretenses
2. Use of interstate wire communication to execute scheme
3. Specific intent to defraud

**United States v. Weimert, 819 F.3d 351, 356 (7th Cir. 2016):**
"Wire fraud requires (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in the scheme with intent to defraud, and (3) use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme."

#### Scheme to Defraud

**United States v. Thomas, 315 F.3d 190, 199 (3rd Cir. 2002):**
"A scheme to defraud includes any plan or course of action intended to deceive others in order to obtain something of value through misrepresentation."

**Material Misrepresentations:**
- False statements of fact
- Omissions of material facts
- Half-truths
- Promises made without intent to perform

#### Property Requirement

**Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25 (1987):**
"The mail and wire fraud statutes reach any scheme to deprive another of money or property."

**Intangible Property Rights:**
- Confidential business information
- Honest services (18 U.S.C. § 1346)
- Economic value
- Contractual rights

### 8.6 Knowledge and Intent for RICO Conspiracy

#### Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63-64 (1997)

**Standard:** "In the context of § 1962(d), a defendant must 'intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all the elements of a substantive criminal offense,' but need not have 'knowledge of all the details of the substantive offense.'"

**Knowledge Required:**
- Awareness of enterprise's general nature and scope
- Agreement to participate in enterprise affairs
- Knowledge that enterprise engaged in racketeering activity

**Not Required:**
- Knowledge of specific predicate acts
- Personal commission of predicate acts
- Agreement to commit each predicate act

#### United States v. Wisniewski, 121 F.3d 464, 473 (9th Cir. 1997)

**Willful Blindness:** "A defendant cannot escape liability by deliberately closing his eyes to facts he had a duty to see or a suspicion he had a duty to investigate."

### 8.7 Civil RICO Requirements

#### 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) - Private Right of Action

"Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court."

#### Standing - Injury to Business or Property

**Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 495 (1985):**
"Plaintiff must allege some injury to business or property. Compensatory damages are available for proven concrete financial loss."

**Injury Must Be:**
- Concrete (not speculative)
- To business or property (not personal injury)
- Caused by predicate acts

**Not Compensable:**
- Personal injury
- Emotional distress (unless economic loss shown)
- Reputational harm alone

#### Proximate Causation

**Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992):**
"RICO's causation requirement is essentially the same as the but-for requirement in tort law. The plaintiff must show that the defendant's violation was a 'but for' cause of his injury."

**Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 461 (2006):**
"Proximate cause requires 'some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'"

**Factors:**
- Directness of injury
- Foreseeability
- Whether other factors intervened
- Difficulty of calculating damages

### 8.8 Conspiracy Agreement

#### Nature of Agreement

**United States v. Ellisor, 522 F.3d 1255, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008):**
"The government need not prove a formal agreement among the conspirators. It is sufficient if the evidence shows a mutual understanding, even if not spelled out in words."

**Evidence of Agreement:**
- Explicit communications
- Coordinated conduct
- Common purpose
- Shared benefits
- Mutual understanding

#### Timing of Agreement

**United States v. Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139 (2d Cir. 1990):**
"The agreement to participate in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering need not predate the enterprise or even all of the predicate acts."

**Requirement:** Agreement must exist while pattern ongoing or enterprise operating

### 8.9 Defenses to RICO Claims

#### Statute of Limitations

**Civil RICO:** 4 years from discovery of injury (*Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc.*, 483 U.S. 143, 156 (1987))

**Accrual:** When plaintiff knew or should have known of injury

**Each Predicate Act:** Separate accrual for each act causing distinct injury

#### Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Doctrine

**Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771 (1984):**
Parent and wholly-owned subsidiary incapable of conspiracy (single economic entity)

**Application to RICO:** Employees of single corporation generally cannot conspire with corporation

**Exception:** If participants have personal stake distinct from employer

#### Lack of Standing

**No Injury to Business or Property:**
- Purely personal injuries
- Speculative damages
- Indirect victims

### 8.10 Remedies in Civil RICO

**18 U.S.C. § 1964(c):**
- Treble damages
- Attorney's fees
- Costs of suit

**Calculation:**
1. Determine actual damages
2. Treble the amount
3. Add attorney's fees and costs

**Injunctive Relief (§ 1964(a)):**
- Divestiture
- Dissolution
- Reorganization
- Restrictions on future activities

### 8.11 Pleading Requirements

#### Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) - Fraud Pleading

**Applies to RICO:** When predicate acts include fraud

**Requirements:**
- Circumstances of fraud with particularity
- Who, what, when, where, how
- Time, place, and content of false representations
- Identity of persons making misrepresentations

**Slaney, 244 F.3d at 597:**
"In the Seventh Circuit, the plaintiff must describe the content of the misrepresentation, identify the person who made the misrepresentation, describe when and where the misrepresentation was made, and explain why the misrepresentation was fraudulent."

### 8.12 Application to Castillo Facts

**Element 1: Enterprise**

**Type of Enterprise:**
- **Legal Entity:** Schwab & Sedgwick as corporations
- **Association-in-Fact:** Group of managers, HR, executives

**Enterprise Analysis:**
- Common purpose: [e.g., systematic suppression of claims, retaliation against whistleblowers]
- Relationships: Organizational hierarchy, coordinated actions
- Longevity: Duration of alleged conduct
- Structure: Distinct from predicate acts (enterprise as vehicle for fraud)

**Element 2: Pattern of Racketeering Activity**

**Predicate Acts - Mail/Wire Fraud:**

**Potential Schemes:**
1. **False Claims to Insurers/Benefits:**
   - Mailings/electronic communications misrepresenting claim denials
   - Fraudulent justifications sent via mail/wire

2. **False Documentation in Employment Actions:**
   - Fabricated performance reviews sent electronically
   - False investigation reports transmitted via wire

3. **Misrepresentations to Regulatory Agencies:**
   - False responses to EEOC sent via mail
   - Fraudulent submissions to DOL via wire

**Identify Specific Acts:**
- **Act 1:** [Date, method, content of fraud, victim]
- **Act 2:** [Date, method, content of fraud, victim]
- Minimum 2 acts required; more strengthens pattern

**Relationship Among Acts:**
- Same purpose: Conceal wrongdoing, avoid liability
- Same methods: False documentation, electronic transmission
- Same victims: Plaintiff, insurers, regulatory agencies
- Similar results: Denied benefits, terminated employment

**Continuity:**
- **Closed-Ended:** Series of acts over [timeframe]
- **Open-Ended:** Threat of continued fraud against future claimants
- Substantial period: Multiple months/years of conduct

**Element 3: Defendant's Knowing Agreement**

**Evidence of Agreement:**
- Coordinated actions among supervisors
- Shared false narrative about plaintiff
- Common purpose in retaliation
- Mutual benefit from suppressing claims

**Knowledge:**
- Awareness of enterprise's fraudulent nature
- Intent to participate in enterprise affairs
- Knowledge that enterprise conducted through racketeering

**Element 4: Causation and Injury**

**Injury to Business or Property:**
- Lost wages and benefits (economic injury)
- Property interest in employment
- Contractual rights violated

**Proximate Causation:**
- Direct link between predicate acts and injury
- Termination resulted from fraudulent scheme
- Damages flowed from mail/wire fraud acts

**But-For Causation:**
- Would plaintiff have been terminated absent fraudulent scheme?
- Would benefits have been denied without false mailings?

**Pleading Requirements:**

**Rule 9(b) Particularity:**

**For Each Predicate Act, Allege:**
- **Who:** Specific person making false statement
- **What:** Exact content of misrepresentation
- **When:** Date of fraudulent communication
- **Where:** Location/medium (email, letter, phone)
- **How:** Manner in which statement was false
- **Why:** Explanation of how statement was fraudulent

**Example:**
"On [Date], [Specific Person] sent an email to [Victim] stating [Exact False Statement]. This statement was false because [True Facts]. The purpose was to [Fraudulent Objective]."

**Pattern Allegations:**
- Describe relationship among acts
- Explain continuity (duration and threat)
- Show common scheme or plan

**Enterprise Allegations:**
- Identify enterprise structure
- Describe common purpose
- Explain longevity and relationships
- Distinguish from predicate acts

**Defenses to Anticipate:**

**Statute of Limitations:**
- When did plaintiff discover injury?
- Which predicate acts within 4-year window?
- Continuing violation doctrine

**Lack of Standing:**
- Injury sufficiently concrete?
- Economic harm vs. personal injury?
- Proximate vs. remote causation?

**Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy:**
- Are all defendants employees of single entity?
- Did participants have personal stake?
- Separate economic interests?

**Insufficient Pattern:**
- Only two acts alleged?
- Acts too closely spaced?
- Lack of continuity threat?

**Strategic Considerations:**

**Advantages of RICO Claim:**
- Treble damages increase settlement value
- Attorney's fees recoverable
- Broad discovery into enterprise operations
- Conspiracy liability for all participants
- Deterrent effect on defendants

**Challenges:**
- High pleading standard (Rule 9(b))
- Difficult to prove enterprise and pattern
- Risk of dismissal if insufficiently pleaded
- Complexity may distract from core claims

**Key Factual Development:**

**Discovery Focus:**
1. Identify all participants in alleged enterprise
2. Obtain communications showing coordination
3. Document pattern of similar conduct toward others
4. Establish financial motivation for scheme
5. Prove use of mail/wire for fraudulent communications
6. Demonstrate enterprise structure and longevity
7. Show plaintiff's direct injury from predicate acts

**Documentation Needed:**
- Emails/letters containing false statements
- Electronic records of fraud
- Evidence of coordination among participants
- Pattern of similar conduct
- Financial documents showing motive
- Communications establishing enterprise

- Reduced by interim earnings or earnings plaintiff could have obtained with reasonable diligence

**Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231 (1982):**
"Back pay is designed to make the victims of unlawful discrimination whole."

#### Components of Back Pay

**Includes:**
- Base salary/wages

- Bonuses
- Commissions
- Shift differentials
- Regular fringe benefits

**EEOC v. N. Star Hosp., Inc., 777 F.3d 898, 903 (7th Cir. 2015):**
"Back pay includes all pecuniary losses flowing from the unlawful employment action."

#### Mitigation Requirement

**Duty to Mitigate:**

**Booker v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., 879 F.2d 1304, 1313 (6th Cir. 1989):**
"A victim of discrimination has a duty to exercise reasonable diligence in finding substantially equivalent employment."

**Reasonable Diligence Standard:**
- Actively search for comparable work
- Apply to available positions
- Accept substantially equivalent employment
- Document search efforts

**Burden:** Defendant bears burden of proving failure to mitigate

#### Taxation of Back Pay Awards

**26 U.S.C. § 104(a)(2):** Back pay awards generally taxable

**Eshelman v. Agere Sys., Inc., 554 F.3d 426, 440 (3rd Cir. 2009):**

### 9.3 Front Pay

#### When Available

**Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 532 U.S. 843, 846 (2001):**
"Front pay is awarded when reinstatement is not feasible."

**Seventh Circuit Standard:**

**McKnight v. General Motors Corp., 908 F.2d 104, 116 (7th Cir. 1990):**
"Front pay is an equitable remedy designed to compensate a victim of discrimination for the loss of future earnings when reinstatement is not a viable option."

#### Circumstances Warranting Front Pay

**Reinstatement Not Feasible When:**
- Hostility between parties
- Position no longer exists
- Employer closed facility
- Trust and confidence destroyed
- Small workforce creating awkward situation

**Williams v. Pharmacia, Inc., 137 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir. 1998):**
"Reinstatement is the preferred remedy, but front pay is appropriate where reinstatement is not feasible."

#### Calculation Methods

**Formula:** Annual salary × Years until mitigation

**Factors:**

**Tubergen v. St. Vincent Hosp. & Health Care Ctr., Inc., 517 F.3d 470, 477 (7th Cir. 2008):**
1. Age of plaintiff
2. Plaintiff's years of service with employer
3. Anticipated length of employment
4. Likelihood of obtaining comparable employment
5. Period during which employment opportunities exist

**Limitation:** Plaintiff's worklife expectancy

#### Present Value Reduction

**Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer, 462 U.S. 523, 537 (1983):**
"Future economic losses must be discounted to present value."

**Calculation:**
- Determine total future losses

### 9.4 Compensatory Damages (ADA/Title VII)

#### 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3) - Statutory Caps

**Employer Size Caps:**
- 15-100 employees: $50,000

6. Medical treatment sought
7. Therapy received

### 9.5 Punitive Damages (ADA/Title VII)

#### 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1)

**Standard:** "Complaining party may recover punitive damages... if the complaining party demonstrates that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice... with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual."

#### Kolstad v. American Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 535 (1999)

**Malice Defined:** "Discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law"

**Reckless Indifference:** "Knowledge that act may violate federal law is not enough; employer must discriminate in the face of a risk that is 'well known' or 'obvious'"

**Standard:** More than negligence or knowledge; requires conscious disregard of rights

#### Manager vs. Employer Liability

**Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 545:**

**Employer Not Liable When:**
1. Discriminatory action contrary to employer's good faith efforts to comply with law
2. Manager acted contrary to employer's policies
3. Employer made reasonable efforts to prevent discrimination

**Employer Liable When:**
- Manager acted within scope of employment
- Discrimination part of company policy/practice
- Senior management participated or ratified

#### Constitutional Limits

**BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574-75 (1996):**

**Due Process Factors:**

### 9.6 Liquidated Damages (FMLA)

#### 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii)

**Double Damages:** "An amount equal to the sum of [actual damages and interest] as liquidated damages"

**Effect:** Doubles back pay and other economic losses

#### Good Faith Defense

**29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii):** Court may reduce or eliminate liquidated damages if employer proves "act or omission was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation."

**Defendant's Burden:**

**Nero v. Indus. Molding Corp., 167 F.3d 921, 929 (5th Cir. 1999):**
"Employer must prove both good faith (subjective) and reasonable grounds (objective)."

**Factors:**
- Employer's efforts to comply
- Consultation with counsel
- Reliance on opinion letters
- Complexity of FMLA issue
- Prior violations

**Presumption:** Liquidated damages are norm, not exception

## Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations

### Case Strengths

1. **Multiple Overlapping Claims:** Plaintiff can pursue multiple theories of liability, increasing likelihood of success on at least one claim

2. **Temporal Proximity:** If timeline shows adverse actions close to protected activity, strong inference of causation

3. **Pattern Evidence:** Multiple claims suggest pattern of retaliation, not isolated business decision

4. **Damages Multipliers:** FMLA liquidated damages and RICO treble damages significantly increase potential recovery

5. **Fee-Shifting Statutes:** Attorney's fees available under all claims, increasing settlement pressure

### Case Challenges

1. **Pretext Burden:** Plaintiff must overcome employer's stated legitimate reasons with evidence of pretext

2. **Specific Intent (ERISA):** Higher burden requiring specific intent to interfere with benefits

3. **RICO Pleading:** Rule 9(b) particularity and pattern requirements difficult to satisfy

4. **Spoliation Proof:** Must show intent to deprive for severe sanctions

5. **Constructive Discharge:** High bar requiring objectively intolerable conditions

### Strategic Priorities

#### Discovery Focus

1. **Timeline Documentation:**
   - Establish precise dates of protected activity and adverse actions
   - Document temporal proximity for causation showing

2. **Comparative Evidence:**
   - Identify similarly situated employees treated differently
   - Show disparate treatment following protected activity

3. **Pretext Evidence:**
   - Obtain inconsistent statements about termination reasons
   - Document deviations from policies
   - Establish shifting justifications

4. **Intent Evidence:**
   - Communications showing retaliatory motive
   - Statements about costs of plaintiff's benefits or leave
   - Emails discussing plaintiff after protected activity

5. **Spoliation:**
   - Document preservation requests
   - Identify missing evidence
   - Establish duty to preserve timeline

#### Motion Practice

1. **Oppose Summary Judgment:**
   - Emphasize credibility determinations for jury
   - Highlight factual disputes on causation
   - Present strong inference from temporal proximity
   - Show pretext through inconsistent evidence

2. **Spoliation Motion:**
   - Seek adverse inference instruction
   - Present circumstantial evidence of intent if direct evidence unavailable
   - Emphasize prejudice from missing evidence

3. **RICO Pleading:**
   - Plead with Rule 9(b) particularity
   - Allege specific predicate acts with who/what/when/where/how
   - Demonstrate pattern with relationship and continuity

#### Trial Strategy

1. **Humanize Plaintiff:**
   - Testimony about impact on family
   - Medical evidence of emotional distress
   - Evidence of diligent job search

2. **Timeline Presentation:**
   - Visual timeline showing protected activity and adverse actions
   - Emphasize suspicious timing

3. **Pretext Theme:**
   - "The real reason was retaliation"
   - Contrast stated reasons with actual evidence
   - Show pattern of changing explanations

4. **Corporate Knowledge:**
   - Establish who knew about protected activity
   - Link decision-makers to retaliatory motive
   - Use cat's paw theory if applicable

5. **Damages Presentation:**
   - Economic expert on back pay, front pay, lost benefits
   - Medical expert on emotional distress
   - Life care planner if ongoing treatment needed

#### Settlement Considerations

**Leverage Points:**
- Treble damages exposure (RICO)
- Liquidated damages presumption (FMLA)
- Punitive damages risk (ADA)
- Uncapped compensatory damages (SOX)
- Attorney's fees multiplier
- Spoliation sanctions potential
- Publicity risk for public company

**Valuation Range:**
- Conservative: Economic damages only
- Moderate: Economic + compensatory + liquidated
- Aggressive: All damages including punitive + RICO trebling + fees
