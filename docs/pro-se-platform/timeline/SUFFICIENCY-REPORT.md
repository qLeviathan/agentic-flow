## FINAL SUMMARY

**Evidence Sufficiency Status: CRITICAL**

- **0% of events currently have Bates citations**
- **85 events require evidence linking**
- **4 critical medical events require records**

- **90-130 minimum documents needed for SJ**

**Action Required:**
1. Bates numbering must be completed
2. Evidence must be cataloged with CAST- numbers
3. Automated linking will populate all citations
4. Forensic analysis of Sedgwick metadata is critical

**Timeline Remains Strong:** Despite evidence gaps, timeline structure, correlation analysis, and legal framework are complete and judge-ready once evidence is linked.

**Next Report:** To be generated upon Bates numbering completion with full evidence links and coverage percentages.
