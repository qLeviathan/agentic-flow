Subject: Request for Accommodation

Jennifer,

I am writing to formally request a reasonable accommodation for my disability.
As discussed during our interactive process meetings, I need modified work hours
to address my ongoing medical condition.

I have been employed with Schwab for 5 years and have consistently met performance
expectations. This accommodation should not impact my job duties.

Please let me know your response within 5 business days.

Best regards,
Marc Castillo
