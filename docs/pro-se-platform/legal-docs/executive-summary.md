## Legal Standards & Precedent

### Prima Facie Retaliation (7th Circuit)

Elements: (1) Protected activity; (2) Employer knowledge; (3) Adverse action; (4) Temporal proximity or other evidence of causation.

**Key Cases:**
- Stone v. City of Indianapolis, 281 F.3d 640 (7th Cir. 2002) - Action within 2 weeks = prima facie timing
- Halloum v. Intel Corp., 658 F.3d 1024 (7th Cir. 2011) - Protected activity and adverse action sufficiency

### Constructive Discharge

**Objective Test (7th Circuit):** Reasonable person would feel compelled to resign.

- Castillo v. County of Cook, 879 F.2d 1370 (7th Cir. 1989)

## Conclusion

The evidence establishes clear prima facie cases on all six claims:

1. **ADA Retaliation**: Disability disclosure followed by documented adverse actions
2. **FMLA Retaliation**: Leave interference and benefits wrongfully denied
3. **ERISA § 510**: Retaliation to discourage benefits claims
4. **SOX Whistleblower**: Protected disclosure followed by negative review within 7 days
5. **Constructive Discharge**: Intolerable conditions forced resignation
6. **Spoliation**: Evidence of destruction and metadata manipulation

Schwab's actions cannot meet any legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation given the temporal proximity and pattern of escalation following each protected disclosure.

**Summary**: X claims verified with 2+ supporting documents, Y claims require additional discovery.
