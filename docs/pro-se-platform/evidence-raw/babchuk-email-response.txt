Subject: Re: Accommodation Request

Marc,

I have reviewed your accommodation request with HR and Legal. While we are
committed to compliance, we cannot approve the specific modification you requested.

However, we are open to discussing alternative arrangements. Please coordinate
with Sara Fowler in HR for further discussion.
