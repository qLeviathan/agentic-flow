## I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment on all claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. The undisputed material facts, supported by extensive documentary evidence, establish that Defendants {{DEFENDANT_1}} and {{DEFENDANT_2}} engaged in unlawful retaliation, interference with protected rights, and spoliation of evidence.

This case involves a calculated campaign of retaliation against {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} following his protected activities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The documentary evidence demonstrates:

1. **ADA Retaliation**: Defendants terminated {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} within {{TERMINATION_TIMEFRAME}} of his disability accommodation request, citing pretextual performance issues that are directly contradicted by his documented performance record.

2. **FMLA Interference**: Defendants failed to properly designate FMLA leave, denied reasonable accommodation alternatives, and retaliated against {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} for exercising his FMLA rights.

3. **ERISA § 510 Violations**: Defendants terminated {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} to prevent vesting of benefits and eliminate future benefit obligations, as evidenced by {{BATES_ERISA_EVIDENCE}}.

4. **SOX Whistleblower Retaliation**: Defendants retaliated against {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} for reporting securities law violations related to {{SOX_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION}}.

5. **Constructive Discharge**: Defendants created intolerable working conditions that forced {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s resignation.

6. **Spoliation**: Defendants intentionally destroyed, manipulated, or withheld critical evidence, including {{SPOLIATION_EXAMPLES}}, warranting adverse inference sanctions.

No reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants' actions were lawful. Summary judgment is appropriate on all claims.

## III. LEGAL STANDARD

### A. Summary Judgment Standard

Summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).

In the Seventh Circuit, the court must construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. *Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.*, 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). However, "the nonmovant must 'do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.'" *Harney v. Speedway SuperAmerica, LLC*, 526 F.3d 1099, 1104 (7th Cir. 2008) (quoting *Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.*, 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)).

A genuine issue of material fact exists when "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." *Anderson*, 477 U.S. at 248.

### B. Pretext Standard

Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). The plaintiff may then demonstrate that the proffered reason is pretextual.

In the Seventh Circuit, pretext can be shown through evidence that the employer's explanation is:
1. "Factually baseless"
2. "Not the actual motivation for the termination"
3. "Insufficient to motivate the discharge"

*Rudin v. Lincoln Land Cmty. Coll.*, 420 F.3d 712, 720 (7th Cir. 2005).

Temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action can constitute circumstantial evidence of causation. *Coleman v. Donahoe*, 667 F.3d 835, 860 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding temporal proximity of days or weeks "highly suggestive" of causation).

---

## IV. ARGUMENT

### A. ADA Retaliation (42 U.S.C. § 12203)

#### 1. Prima Facie Case Established

To establish a prima facie case of ADA retaliation, Plaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. *Sitar v. Indiana Dep't of Transp.*, 344 F.3d 720, 728 (7th Cir. 2003).

**Protected Activity**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} requested reasonable accommodation for {{DISABILITY_DESCRIPTION}} on {{DISABILITY_REQUEST_DATE}}. [Facts 4-5] This accommodation request is protected under 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).

**Adverse Action**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} was terminated on {{TERMINATION_DATE}}. [Fact 1] Termination constitutes a materially adverse employment action. *Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White*, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006).

**Causal Connection**: The temporal proximity of {{TERMINATION_TIMEFRAME}} between the accommodation request and termination establishes causation. *Coleman*, 667 F.3d at 860. Moreover, {{ADDITIONAL_CAUSATION_EVIDENCE}}.

Defendants cannot dispute these elements. Summary judgment on ADA retaliation is appropriate.

#### 2. Defendants' Proffered Reason is Pretextual

Defendants claim {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} was terminated for {{ALLEGED_DEFICIENCIES}}. [Fact 20] This explanation is pretextual for three independent reasons:

**Factually Baseless**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s contemporaneous performance evaluations demonstrate {{ACTUAL_PERFORMANCE}}, directly contradicting Defendants' claims. [Facts 21-22] A reasonable jury could only conclude that the performance deficiencies were fabricated post-hoc to justify unlawful retaliation.

**Not Actual Motivation**: The alleged performance issues were first raised {{TIMING_RELATIVE_TO_PROTECTED_ACTIVITY}} after the accommodation request, despite years of satisfactory performance. [Fact 22] This timing reveals the true motivation: retaliation for protected activity. See *Culver v. Gorman & Co.*, 416 F.3d 540, 547 (7th Cir. 2005) ("timing can be telling").

**Insufficient to Motivate Termination**: Similarly situated employees who did not request accommodation were not disciplined for comparable or worse performance. [Fact 23] This disparate treatment demonstrates that performance was not the actual reason for termination. *Ripberger v. Corizon, Inc.*, 773 F.3d 871, 878 (7th Cir. 2014).

{{ADDITIONAL_PRETEXT_ARGUMENTS}}

### B. FMLA Interference & Retaliation (29 U.S.C. § 2615)

#### 1. FMLA Interference

The FMLA makes it unlawful for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). FMLA interference claims do not require proof of discriminatory intent. *Burnett v. LFW Inc.*, 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006).

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} requested FMLA leave on {{FMLA_REQUEST_DATE}}. [Fact 8] Defendants failed to provide required designation notice within 5 business days, violating 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(b). [Fact 9] This procedural violation constitutes interference with FMLA rights.

Additionally, Defendants' denial of reasonable accommodation alternatives interfered with {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s ability to return from FMLA leave. [Fact 6, 10] The FMLA's implementing regulations require employers to restore employees to equivalent positions with equivalent benefits. 29 C.F.R. § 825.214(a). Defendants' refusal to accommodate {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s disability effectively denied this restoration right.

#### 2. FMLA Retaliation

FMLA retaliation requires proof of: (1) protected activity; (2) adverse action; and (3) causal connection. *Burnett*, 472 F.3d at 477.

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s FMLA leave request is protected activity. [Fact 8] His termination is an adverse action. [Fact 1] The causal connection is established through temporal proximity of {{FMLA_RETALIATION_TIMING}} and {{ADDITIONAL_FMLA_EVIDENCE}}. [Facts 10, 22]

Defendants' pretextual performance explanations fail for the same reasons discussed in Section IV.A.2, *supra*.

### C. ERISA § 510 (29 U.S.C. § 1140)

ERISA § 510 prohibits discharging an employee "for the purpose of interfering with [the] attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1140.

To establish an ERISA § 510 violation, {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} must show: (1) prohibited employer conduct (2) taken for the purpose of interfering (3) with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled. *Dister v. Continental Group, Inc.*, 859 F.2d 1108, 1111 (2d Cir. 1988).

**Prohibited Conduct**: Defendants terminated {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} on {{TERMINATION_DATE}}. [Fact 1]

**Purpose to Interfere**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} had {{YEARS_SERVICE}} years of service and was {{VESTING_STATUS}}. [Fact 12] His termination occurred {{TIMING_RELATIVE_TO_VESTING}}. [Fact 13] Internal communications reveal cost-cutting initiatives targeting long-term employees with significant benefit obligations. [Fact 14]

This evidence establishes specific intent to interfere with benefit rights. *Teumer v. General Motors Corp.*, 34 F.3d 542, 545 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that circumstantial evidence, including timing and cost-saving motive, can establish § 510 violation).

**Attainment of Rights**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} lost {{BENEFITS_LOST}} due to the termination. [EVIDENCE NEEDED: Quantification of lost benefits]

### D. SOX Whistleblower (18 U.S.C. § 1514A)

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act protects employees who report conduct they reasonably believe constitutes securities fraud. 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(a)(1). To establish a SOX violation, {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} must prove: (1) protected activity; (2) employer knowledge; (3) adverse action; and (4) causal connection. *Wiest v. Lynch*, 710 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2013).

**Protected Activity**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} reported {{SOX_VIOLATION_TYPE}} on {{SOX_REPORT_DATE}}. [Fact 16] The reported conduct involved {{SOX_VIOLATION_DETAILS}}, which {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} reasonably believed violated securities laws. [Fact 17]

The "reasonable belief" standard is objective and does not require the employee to prove actual fraud. *Sylvester v. Parexel Int'l LLC*, 878 F.3d 128, 136 (1st Cir. 2017).

**Employer Knowledge**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} reported to {{REPORT_RECIPIENT}}, establishing employer knowledge. [Fact 16]

**Adverse Action**: Termination. [Fact 1]

**Causation**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} was terminated {{SOX_RETALIATION_TIMEFRAME}} after his report. [Fact 18] This temporal proximity, combined with {{ADDITIONAL_SOX_EVIDENCE}}, establishes but-for causation under the SOX standard. *Lawson v. FMR LLC*, 571 U.S. 429, 436 (2014).

### E. Constructive Discharge

Constructive discharge occurs when working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign. *Rabinovitz v. Pena*, 89 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir. 1996).

The Seventh Circuit applies a two-part test: (1) the working conditions must be so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign, and (2) the employer must have created the intolerable conditions with the intent of forcing resignation, or at minimum, the employer could foresee that its actions would force resignation. *EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.*, 243 F.3d 846, 852-53 (4th Cir. 2001).

**Intolerable Conditions**: Following protected activities, Defendants subjected {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} to:
- {{INTOLERABLE_CONDITION_1}} [Fact 25]
- {{INTOLERABLE_CONDITION_2}} [Fact 25]
- {{INTOLERABLE_CONDITION_3}} [Fact 25]

These conditions would compel a reasonable person to resign. *Tutman v. WBBM-TV, Inc.*, 209 F.3d 1044, 1050 (7th Cir. 2000).

**Intent/Foreseeability**: {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} complained to {{COMPLAINT_RECIPIENT}} on {{COMPLAINT_DATE}}, putting Defendants on notice. [Fact 26] Defendants took no remedial action, demonstrating deliberate indifference and foreseeability. [Fact 27]

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s resignation on {{RESIGNATION_DATE}} was forced, not voluntary. [Fact 28]

### F. Spoliation Sanctions (Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2))

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e)(2) authorizes severe sanctions, including adverse inferences, when electronically stored information (ESI) is lost due to a party's failure to preserve, and that party acted with intent to deprive another party of the information's use in litigation.

The Seventh Circuit applies a three-part test: (1) the evidence must have been within the party's control; (2) the evidence must have been actually suppressed or withheld; and (3) the evidence was relevant to claims or defenses such that a reasonable trier of fact could find it would support those claims. *Bracey v. Grondin*, 712 F.3d 1012, 1019 (7th Cir. 2013).

**Control**: {{MISSING_EVIDENCE_DESCRIPTION}} was within Defendants' exclusive control as employer records. [Fact 29]

**Suppression**: Defendants admitted that {{SPOLIATION_ADMISSION}}. [Fact 30] Metadata analysis reveals intentional manipulation: {{METADATA_MANIPULATION_DETAILS}}. [Fact 31] These acts constitute intentional suppression.

**Relevance**: The missing evidence is critical to {{MATERIALITY_EXPLANATION}}. [Fact 33] Specifically:
- {{MATERIALITY_POINT_1}}
- {{MATERIALITY_POINT_2}}
- {{MATERIALITY_POINT_3}}

**Intent**: The combination of document retention policy violations [Fact 32], admission of deletion [Fact 30], and metadata manipulation [Fact 31] demonstrates intent to deprive {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} of evidence.

The Court should impose adverse inference sanctions, instructing the jury to presume that the destroyed evidence would have supported {{PLAINTIFF_NAME}}'s claims. Additionally, Defendants' conduct warrants dismissal of defenses or entry of default judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2)(C).

---

## V. CONCLUSION

The undisputed material facts establish that Defendants engaged in unlawful retaliation across multiple federal statutes, interfered with protected rights, and intentionally destroyed evidence. No reasonable jury could find for Defendants.

{{PLAINTIFF_NAME}} respectfully requests that this Court:

1. **GRANT summary judgment** on all claims;
2. **IMPOSE adverse inference sanctions** for spoliation, instructing the jury that destroyed evidence would have supported Plaintiff's claims, or alternatively, entering default judgment;
3. **AWARD compensatory damages** including:
   - Back pay from {{TERMINATION_DATE}} through trial
   - Front pay or reinstatement
   - Lost benefits (medical, 401(k), ESPP)
   - Emotional distress damages
4. **AWARD liquidated damages** under FMLA (doubling provision);
5. **AWARD punitive damages** for willful and reckless conduct;
6. **AWARD attorneys' fees and costs** pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (ADA), 29 U.S.C. § 2617 (FMLA), and 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(c) (SOX);
7. **GRANT such other relief** as the Court deems just and proper.
