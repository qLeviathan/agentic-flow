EEOC CHARGE NARRATIVE
Case: Castillo v. Charles Schwab & Sedgwick Claims Management Services
Charging Party: Marc Castillo

ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION:

I am filing this charge to formally allege that Charles Schwab and Sedgwick Claims
Management Services engaged in disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and
other applicable employment laws.

FACTS:
1. I requested reasonable accommodation for my disability in March 2024
2. Sedgwick unlawfully denied my disability benefits in April 2024
3. HR explicitly threatened retaliation for taking FMLA leave in May 2024
4. Despite my tenure and performance record, I was passed over for promotion
5. HR continued negative treatment following my accommodation requests

This pattern of conduct constitutes disability discrimination and unlawful retaliation.

[Signed] Marc Castillo
